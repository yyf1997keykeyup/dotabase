Each newborn of the cavernous House Avernus is bathed in the black mist, and by this baptism they are given an innate connection to the mystic energies of the land. They grow up believing themselves fierce protectors of their lineal traditions, the customs of the realm--but what they really are protecting is the Font itself. And the motives of the mist are unclear.When the infant Abaddon was bathed in the Font, they say something went awry. In the child\'s eyes there flared a light of comprehension that startled all present and set the sacerdotes to whispering. He was raised with every expectation of following the path all scions of Avernus took--to train in war, that in times of need he might lead the family\'s army in defense of the ancestral lands. But Abaddon was always one apart. Where others trained with weapons, he bent himself to meditation in the presence of the mist. He drank deep from the vapors that welled from the Font, learning to blend his spirit with the potency that flowed from far beneath the House; he became a creature of the black mist. There was bitterness within the House Avernus--elders and young alike accusing him of neglecting his responsibilities. But all such accusations stopped when Abaddon rode into battle, and they saw how the powers of the mist had given him mastery over life and death beyond those of any lord the House had ever known.'),(1,'Alchemist','Strength','1840 at 25','49 - 58','891 at 25','https://www.dotafire.com/images/hero/icon/alchemist.png','The sacred science of Chymistry was a Darkbrew family tradition, but no Darkbrew had ever shown the kind of creativity, ambition, and recklessness of young Razzil. However, when adulthood came calling he pushed aside the family trade to try his hand at manufacturing gold through Alchemy. In an act of audacity befitting his reputation, Razzil announced he would transmute an entire mountain into gold. Following two decades of research and spending and preparation, he failed spectacularly, quickly finding himself imprisoned for the widespread destruction his experiment wrought. Yet Razzil was never one to take a setback lightly, and sought escape to continue his research. When his new cellmate turned out to be a fierce ogre, he found just the opportunity he needed. After convincing the ogre not to eat him, Razzil set about carefully concocting a tincture for it to drink, made from the molds and mosses growing in the prison stone work. In a week’s time, it seemed ready. When the ogre drank the potion, it flew into an unstoppable berserker rage, destroying the cell bars and exploding through walls and guards alike. They soon found themselves lost somewhere in the forest surrounding the city with a trail of wreckage in their wake and no signs of pursuit. In the tonic’s afterglow, the ogre seemed serene, happy, and even eager. Resolving to work together, the pair set off to collect the materials needed to attempt Razzil’s alchemical transmutation once more.'),(2,'Ancient Apparition','Intelligence','1500 at 25','44 - 54','1323 at 25','https://www.dotafire.com/images/hero/icon/ancient-apparition.png','Kaldr, the Ancient Apparition, is an image projected from outside time. He springs from the cold, infinite void that both predates the universe and awaits its end. Kaldr is, Kaldr was, Kaldr shall be...and what we perceive, powerful as it appears to us, is but the faintest faded echo of the true, eternal Kaldr. Some believe that as the cosmos ages and approaches its final moments, the brightness and power of Kaldr will also intensify--that the Ancient Apparition will grow younger and stronger as eternity\'s end draws nigh. His grip of ice will bring all matter to a stop, his image will cast a light too terrible to behold.

Ascetic and pragmatic, in their remote monastic eyrie they remained aloof from mundane strife, wrapped in meditation that knew no gods or elements of magic. Then came the Legion of the Dead God, crusaders with a sinister mandate to replace all local worship with their Unliving Lord\'s poisonous nihilosophy. From a landscape that had known nothing but blood and battle for a thousand years, they tore the souls and bones of countless fallen legions and pitched them against Turstarkuri. The monastery stood scarcely a fortnight against the assault, and the few monks who bothered to surface from their meditations believed the invaders were but demonic visions sent to distract them from meditation. They died where they sat on their silken cushions. Only one youth survived--a pilgrim who had come as an acolyte, seeking wisdom, but had yet to be admitted to the monastery. He watched in horror as the monks to whom he had served tea and nettles were first slaughtered, then raised to join the ranks of the Dead God\'s priesthood. With nothing but a few of Turstarkuri\'s prized dogmatic scrolls, he crept away to the comparative safety of other lands, swearing to obliterate not only the Dead God\'s magic users--but to put an end to magic altogether.'),(4,'Arc Warden','Agility','2140 at 25','46 - 56','1107 at 25','https://www.dotafire.com/images/hero/icon/arc-warden.png','Before the beginning of all, there existed a presence: a primordial mind, infinite, awesome, and set to inscrutable purpose. As the universe thundered into being, this mind was fragmented and scattered. Two among its greater fragments--who would come to be named Radiant and Dire--found themselves locked in vicious opposition, and began twisting all of creation to serve their conflict.\nAs war and cataclysm threatened the nascent cosmos, the will of a third fragment made itself known. Naming itself Zet, this intellect sought to resolve the disharmony and return all to perfect unity. Appalled by its kin\'s conflicting nature, Zet gathered the sum of its power. In a sudden flash, it overwhelmed its siblings, and fused the warring aspects into a stellar sphere before hurling them into the darkness to orbit a nondescript world. Harmony was restored, though only the barest fraction of Zet\'s strength remained. Setting its gaze on the prison, Zet chose to use its weakened power to serve as watchful warden until time\'s end. For uncounted aeons, this vigil stood.\n\nLife flourished upon the world below, oblivious to the dangers imprisoned within the softly glowing moon, or of Zet\'s struggles to contain them. As the captives\' eternal clash reverberated within, the surface of the prison shuddered, over time beginning to crack. Ultimately, Zet\'s depleted power proved insufficient to contain the breach, and at last the moon was shattered. The prison\'s ancient inhabitants had escaped to sow their conflict anew.\n\nFlung to the farthest reaches by the prison\'s explosion, Zet was transformed by the dissonant energies of its former captives. No longer of single form and thought, its presence had become split among many--some lesser, some greater--each connected by a fleeting arc of consciousness. Struggling to suppress its own disunity, Zet sped toward the burgeoning conflict of its siblings, bending its fractured wills toward a singular conclusion: the aspects of the primordial mind must be made to reunite, or all must be destroyed lest the conflict spread further...'),(5,'Axe','Strength','2320 at 25','49 - 53','747 at 25','https://www.dotafire.com/images/hero/icon/axe.png','As a grunt in the Army of Red Mist, Mogul Khan set his sights on the rank of Red Mist General. In battle after battle he proved his worth through gory deed. His rise through the ranks was helped by the fact that he never hesitated to decapitate a superior. Through the seven year Campaign of the Thousand Tarns, he distinguished himself in glorious carnage, his star of fame shining ever brighter, while the number of comrades in arms steadily dwindled. On the night of ultimate victory, Axe declared himself the new Red Mist General, and took on the ultimate title of \'Axe.\' But his troops now numbered zero. Of course, many had died in battle, but a significant number had also fallen to Axe\'s blade. Needless to say, most soldiers now shun his leadership.

Also known as Atropos, Bane was born from the midnight terrors of the goddess Nyctasha. A force of terror too powerful to be contained by sleep, he surfaced from her slumbers, fed upon her immortality, and stole his vaporous form from her inky blood. He is the essence of fear. Mortals who hear his voice hear their darkest secrets whispered in their ear. He calls to the hidden fear in every Hero\'s heart. Wakefulness is no protection, for Bane\'s black blood, continuously dripping, is a tar that traps his enemies in nightmare.

By bite, or claw, or pincer, or hoof, even the slightest sign of weakness means a swift death. They say the Rider was just a lad cutting chaff in his family\'s field when he was taken, swept up by a massive morde-bat looking for take-out. But this boy had a better idea, and wriggled his way from his captor\'s grip, onto the beast\'s back, and hacked it down with his tools. Emerging from the bloody wreckage and intoxicated by the thrill of flight, the boy realized he\'d found his calling. The boy grew, and every summer he\'d return to his family\'s field, often setting out into the bush seeking to reclaim that first thrill of facing death in the form of jaws or a fatal fall. The years went on, but his fire only grew stronger. He studied the overgrowth, plunging deeper with each expedition, until finally he found his way to the caves at the heart of hostility. They say the Rider, on the eve of a scorching summer night, had nothing but a rope, a bottle of liquid courage and a burning determination to feel the skies once more, when he plunged inside...'),(8,'Beastmaster','Strength','2040 at 25','64 - 68','807 at 25','https://www.dotafire.com/images/hero/icon/beastmaster.png','Karroch was born a child of the stocks. His mother died in childbirth; his father, a farrier for the Mad King of Slom, was trampled to death when he was five. Afterward Karroch was indentured to the king’s menagerie, where he grew up among all the beasts of the royal court: lions, apes, fell-deer, and things less known, things barely believed in. When the lad was seven, an explorer brought in a beast like none before seen. Dragged before the King in chains, the beast spoke, though its mouth moved not. Its words: a plea for freedom. The King only laughed and ordered the beast perform for his amusement; and when it refused, struck it with the Mad Scepter and ordered it dragged to the stocks.\n\nOver the coming months, the boy Karroch sneaked food and medicinal draughts to the wounded creature, but only managed to slow its deterioration. Wordlessly, the beast spoke to the boy, and over time their bond strengthened until the boy found he could hold up his end of a conversation--could in fact speak now to all the creatures of the King\'s menagerie. On the night the beast died, a rage came over the boy. He incited the animals of the court to rebel and threw open their cages to set them amok on the palace grounds. The Mad King was mauled in the mayhem. In the chaos, one regal stag bowed to the boy who had freed him; and with Beastmaster astride him, leapt the high walls of the estate, and escaped. Now a man, Karroch the Beastmaster has not lost his ability to converse with wild creatures.

The Flayed Ones require oceanic amounts of blood to keep them sated and placated, and would soon drain their mountain empire of its populace if the priests of the high plateaus did not appease them. Strygwyr therefore goes out in search of carnage. The vital energy of any blood he lets, flows immediately to the Twins through the sacred markings on his weapons and armor. Over the years, he has come to embody the energy of a vicious hound; in battle he is savage as a jackal. Beneath the Mask of the Bloodseeker, in the rush of bloody quenching, it is said that you can sometime see the features of the Flayers taking direct possession of their Hound.'),(10,'Bounty Hunter','Agility','1800 at 25','45 - 59','879 at 25','https://www.dotafire.com/images/hero/icon/bounty-hunter.png','When the hunted tell tales of Gondar the Bounty Hunter, none are sure of which are true. In whispered tones they say he was abandoned as a kit, learning his skill in tracking as a matter of simple survival. Others hear he was an orphan of war, taken in by the great Soruq the Hunter to learn the master’s skill with a blade as they plumbed the dark forests for big game. Still others believe he was a lowly street urchin raised among a guild of cutpurses and thieves, trained in the arts of stealth and misdirection. Around campfires in the wild countryside his quarry speaks the rumors of Gondar’s work, growing ever more fearful: they say it was he who tracked down the tyrant King Goff years after the mad regent went into hiding, delivering his head and scepter as proof. That it was he who infiltrated the rebel camps at Highseat, finally bringing the legendary thief White Cape to be judged for his crimes. And that it was he who ended the career of Soruq the Hunter, condemned as a criminal for killing the Prince’s prized hellkite. The tales of Gondar’s incredible skill stretch on, with each daring feat more unbelievable than the last, each target more elusive. For the right price, the hunted know, anyone can be found.

Born to a mother’s flesh by a Celestial father, the youth known as Mangix was the first to grow up with the talents of both lineages. He trained with the greatest aesthetes of the Order, eventually earning, through diligent drunkenness, the right to challenge for the title of Brewmaster—that appellation most honored among the contemplative malt-brewing sect. As much drinking competition as mortal combat, Mangix for nine days drank and fought the elder master. For nine nights they stumbled and whirled, chugged and struck, until at last the elder warrior collapsed into a drunken stupor, and a new Brewmaster was named. Now the new, young Brewmaster calls upon the strength of his Oyo forebears to speed his staff. When using magic, it is to his spirit ancestors that he turns. Like all Brewmasters before him, he was sent out from his people with a single mission. He wanders the land, striving toward enlightenment through drink, searching for the answer to the ancient spiritual schism—hoping to think the single thought that will unite the spirit and physical planes again.'),(12,'Bristleback','Strength','2020 at 25','44 - 54','1047 at 25','https://www.dotafire.com/images/hero/icon/bristleback.png','Never one to turn his back on a fight, Rigwarl was known for battling the biggest, meanest scrappers he could get his hands on. Christened Bristleback by the drunken crowds, he waded into backroom brawls in every road tavern between Slom and Elze, until his exploits finally caught the eye of a barkeep in need of an enforcer. For a bit of brew, Bristleback was hired to collect tabs, keep the peace, and break the occasional leg or two (or five, in the case of one unfortunate web-hund).\n\nAfter indulging in a night of merriment during which bodily harm was meted out in equal parts upon both delinquent patrons and his own liver, Bristleback finally met his match. “Your tusks offend me, sir,” he was heard to drunkenly slur to one particularly large fellow from the northern wastes whose bill had come due. What followed was a fight for the ages. A dozen fighters jumped in. No stool was left unbroken, and in the end, the impossible happened: the tab went unpaid. Over the weeks that followed, Bristleback\'s wounds healed, and his quills grew back; but an enforcer\'s honor can be a prickly thing. He paid the tab from his own coin, vowing to track down this northerner and extract redemption.

In a later age, the Vizier of Greed, Ptholopthales, erected his lodestone ziggurat on the slopes of the dead volcano, knowing that any looters who sought his magnetic wealth must survive the spider-haunted passages. After millennia of maternal peace, Black Arachnia found herself beset by a steady trickle of furfeet and cutpurses, bold knights and noble youths--all of them delicious, certainly, and yet tending to create a less than nurturing environment for her innocent offspring. Tiring of the intrusions, she paid a visit to Ptholopthales; and when he proved unwilling to discuss a compromise, she wrapped the Vizier in silk and set him aside to be the centerpiece of a special birthday feast. Unfortunately, the absence of the Magnetic Ziggurat\'s master merely emboldened a new generation of intruders. When one of her newborns was trodden underfoot by a clumsy adventurer, she reached the end of her silken rope. Broodmother headed for the surface, declaring her intent to rid the world of each and every possible invader, down to the last Hero if necessary, until she could ensure her nursery might once more be a safe and wholesome environment for her precious spiderspawn.'),(14,'Centaur Warrunner','Strength','2940 at 25','63 - 65','711 at 25','https://www.dotafire.com/images/hero/icon/centaur-warchief.png','It\'s said that a centaur\'s road is paved with the corpses of the fallen.

For centaurs, combat is the perfect articulation of thought, the highest expression of self. If killing is an art among centaurs, then Bradwarden the Warrunner is their greatest artist. He rose to dominance on the proving grounds of Omexe, an ancient arena where centaur clans have for millennia gathered to perform their gladiatorial rights. As his fame spread, spectators came from far and wide to see the great centaur in action. Always the first to step into the arena, and the last to leave, he composes a masterpiece in each guttering spray, each thrust of blood-slickened blade-length. It is the poetry of blood on steel, flung in complex patterns across the pale sands of the killing floor.\nWarrunner defeated warrior after warrior, until the arena boomed with the cheering of his name, and he found himself alone, the uncontested champion of his kind. The great belt of Omexe was bestowed, wrapped around his broad torso, but in his victory, the death-artist found only emptiness. For what is a warrior without a challenge?

Always on the edge of starvation and thirst, fighting amongst their neighbors and each other, Chen’s clan made the mistake, one fateful day, of ambushing the wrong caravan.\n\nIn the vicious battle that followed, Chen’s clan was outmatched.

Moved by Chen’s obvious courage, the executioner halted his sword. Instead of the blade, Chen was given a choice: death or conversion. Chen took to the faith with a ferocity.

The greatest mages in those days were the ones blessed with the greatest memories, and yet so complex were the invocations that all wizards were forced to specialize. The most devoted might hope in a lifetime to have adequate recollection of three spells—four at most. Ordinary wizards were content to know two, and it was not uncommon for a village mage to know only one—with even that requiring him to consult grimoires as an aid against forgetfulness on the rare occasions when he might be called to use it. But among these early practitioners there was one exception, a genius of vast intellect and prodigious memory who came to be known as the Invoker. In his youth, the precocious wizard mastered not four, not five, not even seven incantations: He could command no fewer than ten spells, and cast them instantly. Many more he learned but found useless, and would practice once then purge from his mind forever, to make room for more practical invocations. One such spell was the Sempiternal Cantrap—a longevity spell of such power that those who cast it in the world\'s first days are among us still (unless they have been crushed to atoms). Most of these quasi-immortals live quietly, afraid to admit their secret: But Invoker is not one to keep his gifts hidden.

It is only in the controlled warping of these forces that Wisp’s presence can be experienced on the physical plane.

The last practicioner of his art, Juggernaut\'s confidence and courage are the result of endless practice; his inventive bladework proves that he has never stopped challenging himself.

Desperate, the Suicide-Mages of Cladd committed their ultimate rite, summoning a host of ancestral spirits to protect the fleet. Against the Demons, this was just barely enough to turn the tide. As Kunkka watched the Demons take his ships down one by one, he had the satisfaction of wearing away their fleet with his ancestral magic. But at the battle\'s peak, something in the clash of demons, men and atavistic spirits must have stirred a fourth power that had been slumbering in the depths. The waves rose up in towering spouts around the few remaining ships, and Maelraun the Tentacular appeared amid the fray. His tendrils wove among the ships, drawing demon and human craft together, churning the water and wind into a raging chaos. What happened in the crucible of that storm, none may truly say. The Cataract roars off into the void, deserted by its former denizens. Kunkka is now Admiral of but one ship, a ghostly rig which endlessly replays the final seconds of its destruction.

Tresdin lifted her blood-stained sword and settled her sights on the beast. It turned, smiling at her through a maze of teeth. Heedless of the battle raging around them, they charged one another.\n\nDeflecting blow after blow, the pair danced their deadly duel as the Bronze Legion met its end around them. Tresdin leapt forward as her foe swung its sword to meet her. The odds turned. The attack smashed into Tresdin suddenly, a brutal thrust from the side, but even as her balance slipped she rallied her strength for another stroke. Blade scraped on blade, beyond the hilt to the gnarled paw below, carving it in two in a fearsome spray of sparks and blood. The vile audience looked on in astonishment as she pressed the attack, driving her blade through her foe\'s flesh into the stampeding heart within. With a scream that split the clouds above, the beast erupted in a torrent of gore and anguish. The stygian portal wavered, the power sustaining the chasm beyond vanishing as suddenly as it had appeared. The remaining invaders fell quickly to Stonehall steel.\n\nThough victorious, the survivors saw little to celebrate: the city lay in ruins, and survivors were few. Fires continued to spread.

Now the darkest depths of his enlightenment are illumined only by the fitful glare of his arrogance.

He only fell for a year or so before an outcrop snagged him. There he rested, dead but undecaying, until the geomancer Anhil thought to verify the legend of the supposedly bottomless Black Pool. Anhil\'s plumbline snarled with the ropes that bound the drowned magician, and up he hauled an unexpected prize. Thinking that by rendering the dead undead, he could question the Lich about the properties of the pool, he removed the bindings and commenced a simple rite of resurrection.

Over the years, its chains had corroded, along with its sanity; N\'aix retained no memory of its former life and no longer dreamt of escape. Seeing a perfect vessel for his plans, the wizard wove a spell of Infestation and cast his life-force into N\'aix\'s body, intending to compel N\'aix to sacrifice itself in a frenzy of violence while the mage returned to his body and crept away unnoticed. Instead, the wizard found his mind caught in a vortex of madness so powerful that it swept away his plans and shattered his will. Jarred to consciousness by the sudden infusion of fresh life, N\'aix woke from its nightmare of madness and obeyed the disembodied voice that filled its skull, which had only the one thought: To escape. In that moment Lifestealer was born. The creature cast its mind into dungeon guards and soldiers, compelling them to open locks and cut down their companions, opening an unobstructed path to freedom while feeding on their lives.

The exasperated parents of these incompatible offspring went through half a dozen homesteads, losing one to fire, the next to ice, before they realized life would be simpler if the children were separated. As the oldest, Lina was sent far south to live with a patient aunt in the blazing Desert of Misrule, a climate that proved more than comfortable for the fiery Slayer.

Such was Lion’s rage that he followed the demon back to hell and slew it, ripping it limb from limb, taking its demonic hand for his own. However, such demonoplasty comes at a cost. Lion was transfigured by the process, his body transformed into something unrecognizable. He rose from hell, rage incarnate, slaying even those who had once called him master, and laying waste to the lands where he had once been so adored.

Without a sound, it turned and left. Fury overtook her. Clutching a rust-eaten dagger, she charged after the beast determined to reclaim even a shred of her past glory, but her quarry would not be caught. Three times she cornered the creature among the rocks and trees, and three times she pounced only to witness its fading shadow darting further into the woods.

When the woman brandished her dagger, the creature reared and roared and charged. Death, it seemed, had come for her at long last in this strange place. She stood, calm and ready. A flash of movement, and the beast snatched the dagger from her hand before vanishing into the forest. Stillness. Hooded figures approached.

But though his body was changed, his spirit remained intact, and instead of biting the exposed neck of his father, he attacked his handlers, tearing them to pieces. A dozen of the King’s knights perished under the wolf’s teeth before they managed to drive it off into the night. Lord Ambry laughed from his chains even as the King ran him through with a sword.

For his was a special transformation, guided by the grace of Nyx. He was the chosen one, selected from the many and anointed with an extract of the queen goddess herself. Not all survive the dark blessing of the queen’s chamber, but he emerged with a penetrating mind, and dagger-like claws–his razor sharp mandibles raking the air while his thoughts projected directly into the minds of those around him. Of all zealot scarabs, he alone was selected for the highest calling. After his metamorphosis, he was reborn, by grace of Nyx, with abilities which shaped him for one thing and one thing only: to kill in the name of his goddess.'),(65,'Ogre Magi','Intelligence','2380 at 25','58 - 64','915 at 25','https://www.dotafire.com/images/hero/icon/ogre-magi.png','The ordinary ogre is the creature for whom the phrase \'As dumb as a bag of rock hammers\' was coined. In his natural state, an ogre is supremely incapable of doing or deciding anything. Clothed in dirt, he sometimes finds himself accidentally draped in animal skins after eating lanekill. Not an especially social creature, he is most often found affectionately consorting with the boulders or tree-stumps he has mistaken for kin (a factor that may explain the ogre\'s low rate of reproduction). However, once every generation or so, the ogre race is blessed with the birth of a two-headed Ogre Magi, who is immediately given the traditional name of Aggron Stonebreak, the name of the first and perhaps only wise ogre in their line\'s history. With two heads, Ogre Magi finds it possible to function at a level most other creatures manage with one. And while the Ogre Magi will win no debates (even with itself), it is graced with a divine quality known as Dumb Luck--a propensity for serendipitous strokes of fortune which have allowed the ogre race to flourish in spite of enemies, harsh weather, and an inability to feed itself. It\'s as if the Goddess of Luck, filled with pity for the sadly inept species, has taken Ogre Magi under her wing. And who could blame her?

He had spent his entire life in the service of the Omniscience, the All Seeing One. Theirs was a holy struggle, and so embedded was he in his duty that he never questioned it so long as he had the strength to fight and the impetuous valor that comes with youth. But over the long years of the crusade, as his elders passed away and were buried in sorry graves at the side of muddy tracks, as his bond-brothers fell in battle to uncouth creatures that refused to bow to the Omniscience, as his own squires were chewed away by ambush and plague and bad water, he began to question the meaning of his vows--the meaning of the whole crusade. After deep meditation, he parted ways with his army and commenced a long trek back to the cave-riddled cliffs of Emauracus, and there he set a challenge to the priests of the Omniscience. No knight had ever questioned them before, and they tried to throw him into the pit of sacrifice, but Purist would not be moved. For as he faced them down, he began to glow with a holy light, and they saw that the Omniscience had chosen to reveal Itself to him. The Elder Hierophant led him on a journey of weeks down into the deepest chamber, the holy of holies, where waited not some abstract concept of wisdom and insight, not some carved relic requiring an injection of imagination to believe in, but the old one itself. It had not merely dwelt in those rocks for billions of aeons; no, It had created them. The Omniscience had formed the immense mineral shell of the planet around itself, as a defense against the numerous terrors of space. Thus the All Seeing One claimed to have created the world, and given the other truths revealed to Puritan on that day, the knight had no reason to refute the story. Perhaps the Omniscience is a liar, deep in its prison of stone, and not the world\'s creator at all, but Omniknight never again questioned his faith. His campaign had meaning at last. And there can be no question that the glorious powers that imbue him, and give his companions such strength in battle, are real beyond any doubt.'),(67,'Oracle','Intelligence','1740 at 25','39 - 45','1479 at 25','https://www.dotafire.com/images/hero/icon/oracle.png','Ascendants to the Great Seat of Cymurri had for ages imported their Oracles exclusively from the Ivory Incubarium, high in the hollow peaks of the Zealot\'s Range, with a downpayment made at the time of the embryo\'s conception and the balance surrendered on delivery of a mature, well-trained prophet to the Gate of the Graven King.\nRaised by same Pallid Sybils who bred and birthed them, all sanctioned Oracles were anchored by their physical form to the world we most of us share; meanwhile, their souls roamed far afield, barely bound by the airiest astral umbilicus. From such cosmic roamings the prophets would return, speaking words of fire with tongues of flesh. Their mystic utterances were analyzed by the Cymurri Advisors, who found in them visions of the future, diplomatic advice, all the supernatural ammunition the line of Graven Kings needed to secure victory in every campaign, whether in the court or on the battlefield. Thus it went for generations, the Graventome\'s pages filling with the names of triumphant kings and the new domains they had acquired. So it went, that is, until the particular Oracle named Nerif arrived to serve the very last of the stone-helmed kings.\n\nFrom the first, Nerif\'s prophecies were unusual. They seemed not merely to portend the future, but to shape it. The weird soothsayer croaked out advice no one had requested, and suddenly the Cymurri found themselves immersed in conflicts with newfound enemies. The Advisors, sensing a threat to their power, were quick to pin these unwelcome developments on the latest Oracle. They demanded his removal, petitioning the Sybils to reclaim their defective prophet and replace him with a worthy substitute. But Nerif described an ominous dream of the Incubarium\'s destruction, and within hours came news of the ancient school\'s destruction in a catastrophic avalanche. Fearing the same fate as the Pallid Sybils, the Advisors withdrew to their counsel chambers, suddenly anxious to avoid the Oracle\'s notice. The Graven King, however, was a creature of great practicality. He doubted the commitment of his overprudent Advisors. An Oracle of such rarity, he reasoned, ought be used as a weapon to enlarge his domain. He therefore demoted his timid counselors and stationed Nerif at his side. With only a blunt understanding of Nerif\'s talent, he boldly stated the outcomes he desired, and coaxed Nerif into uttering his wishes as prophecy.\n\nAt first, all was well. The Last Graven King boasted that by adopting Fate\'s pet, he had made a plaything of Fate itself. He should have taken it as a warning then when, on the eve of his invasion of the Unsated Satrap\'s realm, he attempted to coerce a prediction of certain victory from his Oracle, only to hear Nerif quietly mutter, \"It could go either way.\" No firmer statement could he force from Nerif\'s lips. Still, the King was confident in his army. The Satrapy was landlocked, poorly armed, and shut off from all possible allies. He took \"It could go either way\" to indicate that with tactical might on his side, there was little risk in his plan.\n\nOf course, we now know that he should have taken the sayer\'s words more literally. Even with careful study of the Annotated Annals of If, what happened on the field before the Unsated Satrap\'s palace is almost impossible to visualize. It appears that in the midst of the carnage, the battle began to bifurcate. At each pivotal moment, reality calved and broke into bits. Soldiers who staggered and fell in battle also stood sure-footed, forging onward to fight. Their minds also split; the warriors found themselves both dead and alive, existent and non-existent. Victory and defeat were partitioned, so that each separate outcome was experienced in simultaneity by both armies. The universe became a hall of mirrors, with all the mirrors endlessly shattering.\n\nThe immediate effect on both parties was insanity. Unable to comprehend the state of being both triumphant and defeated, the Graven King\'s mind dispersed into motes of madness. The naive Satrap fared no better. The opposing paired realities continued to split and split again, echoing into infinite histories, all of them populated by a bewildered populace that soon lost the ability to feed, clothe, defend, or reproduce itself in the traditional manner.\n\nLong before the repercussions had played out, however, Cymurri\'s wary Advisors had seized Nerif, bound and gagged him, and launched him out of their universe at high speed on a dimensional barque, in the hopes of depositing him where he could do them no harm forever. It was, of course, too late for them.

With his whole being focused on his vigil, Outworld Destroyer paid little attention to events closer in to the sun. But at last the clamor of the Ancients, and a sense of growing threat from within as well as without, sent him winging sunward to visit the plains of war.

Placed with his kin in the vanguard of the final assault against the Dread Magus Vorn, the cost to his fellows was absolute. As the charging force battled toward the fortress, Azwraith alone among his kind remained standing, and he alone was able to infiltrate the keep. Focused and infuriated by the slaughter of his brothers, Azwraith bested each of the wizard\'s deadly traps and conjured guardians. Soon the simple fisherman arrived at Vorn\'s tower sanctum. The pair dueled through the night, pike to staff, as chaos raged below, and with a deafening cry Azwraith pierced his enemy. But the wizard did not simply expire; he exploded into uncountable shards of light, penetrating his killer with power.\n\nAs the dust settled and the smoke of combat began to clear, Azwraith found himself standing among a throng of his kin. Each seemed to be dressed as he was, each seemed armed as he was, and he could sense that each thought as he did. Aware that his allies were approaching, he willed these phantoms to hide themselves, and one by one they began to vanish into nothingness. As the soldiers came upon the sanctum, they found the warrior that had bested the wizard. When they approached their champion, the lancer vanished. The pikeman who had stood before them was no more than another phantom.

So would this dazzling cycle of birth and rebirth repeat until all skies hewn of Titan toil deigned to twinkle and shine.\n\nBy this ageless crucible the star that mortals would come to call Phoenix collapsed into being, and like its ancestors was thrust into an endless cosmos to find a place among its stellar brethren. Yet curiosity toward that which the dimming elders comfort in the darkness consumed the fledgling, and so over long cycles it inquired and studied. It learned that among worlds both whole and broken would soon stir a nexus of remarkable variety locked in an enduring conflict of cosmic consequence, a plane which would find itself in need of more influence than a dying sun\'s distant rays could provide.

From the moment of their master\'s death, the regents of the temple began rites of divination to identify their master\'s reincarnation, and eventually all signs converged on the immediate neighborhood. Several villages squatted in the shadow of the temple, their alleys and plazas full of the laughter of squalling children. Pugna, a mere thirteen months of age, was but one candidate among the local brats, and on the appointed day he was presented at the temple alongside two other promising tots. The lamas offered a jumble of worn relics to the children, treasured possessions of their former grandmaster. One boy reached for a porphyry wand that had belonged to the lama...and put it in his nostril. An impish girl pulled out an amulet that had also been the lama\'s, and immediately swallowed it. Pugna regarded the other two coolly, gave a merry laugh, and blasted them with gouts of emerald flame, reducing them to ashes in an instant. He then snatched up the wand and amulet, saying \'Mine!\' The regents hoisted the beaming Pugna on their shoulders, wrapped him in their grandmaster\'s vestments, and rushed him to the throne before his mood could change.

The creature who arrived, visited upon him such exquisite torments that he named her his Secret Queen, and he began to spend all his spare moments submitting to her clever torments--eventually abdicating all his responsibilities in his pursuit of the painful pleasures that only she could bring. Queen of Pain could bring him to the brink of death, but she was rune-bound to keep him alive. At last the King\'s neglect of state brought on an uprising.

As he casually tossed the twelfth of a string of would-be killers from a high balcony, it dawned on him how utterly unimaginative the attempts on his life had become. Where once the interruption of a fingersnap or firehand might have put a cheerful spring in his step, it had all become so very predictable. He craved greater competition.

It will undoubtedly be instructive.'),(113,'Weaver','Agility','1380 at 25','50 - 60','747 at 25','https://www.dotafire.com/images/hero/icon/weaver.png','The fabric of creation needs constant care, lest it grow tattered; for when it unravels, whole worlds come undone. It is the work of the Weavers to keep the fabric tight, to repair worn spots in the mesh of reality. They also defend from the things that gnaw and lay their eggs in frayed regions, whose young can quickly devour an entire universe if the Weavers let their attention lapse. Skitskurr was a master Weaver, charged with keep one small patch of creation tightly woven and unfaded. But the job was not enough to satisfy. It nagged him that the original work of creation all lay in the past; the Loom had done its work and traveled on. He wanted to create rather than merely maintain—to weave worlds of his own devising. He began making small changes to his domain, but the thrill of creation proved addictive, and his strokes became bolder, pulling against the pattern that the Loom had woven. The guardians came, with their scissors, and Weaver\'s world was pared off, snipped from the cosmic tapestry, which they rewove without him in it. Skitskurr found himself alone, apart from his kind, a state that would have been torment for any other Weaver. But Skitskurr rejoiced, for now he was free. Free to create for himself, to begin anew. The raw materials he needed to weave a new reality were all around him. All he had to do was tear apart this old world at the seams.'),(114,'Windranger','Intelligence','2000 at 25','42 - 54','1155 at 25','https://www.dotafire.com/images/hero/icon/windranger.png','The western forests guard their secrets well. One of these is Lyralei, master archer of the wood, and favored godchild of the wind. Known now as Windrunner, Lyralei\'s family was killed in a storm on the night of her birth—-their house blown down by the gale, contents scattered to the winds. Only the newborn survived among the debris field of death and destruction. In the quiet after the storm, the wind itself took notice of the lucky infant crying in the grass. The wind pitied the child and so lifted her into the sky and deposited her on a doorstep in a neighboring village. In the years that followed, the wind returned occasionally to the child’s life, watching from a distance while she honed her skills. Now, after many years of training, Windrunner fires her arrows true to their targets. She moves with blinding speed, as if hastened by a wind ever at her back. With a flurry of arrows, she slaughters her enemies, having become, nearly, a force of nature herself.'),(115,'Winter Wyvern','Intelligence','1960 at 25','38 - 45','1419 at 25','https://www.dotafire.com/images/hero/icon/winter-wyvern.png','Like many great poets, Auroth just wants time to write, but the Winter Wyvern\'s life is full of interruptions. The epics of the Eldwurms have a long and colorful history, but some fear that the remaining dragon scholars are not as prolific as they once were, with few lines added to the Eldwurm Eddas since the last age of greatness. Auroth laments: \"We forget that there is more to life than triumph and dominion over enemies. We must also live our lives in the pursuit of creative expression.\" She embarks on research expeditions, collecting books for inspiration. But all this research can be terribly distracting, and she spends less time writing than she should. Although she knows she should be lurking in her lair, adding to the Eddas, she finds herself engaged in epic battles against powerful enemies. She loots castles, raids ancient libraries... and if she happens to heap glory on herself in the process, she tells herself that it\'s merely a side effect of her research. The fact is, while her skill and power on the battlefield are legendary, her scholarly travails have thus far hardly been the stuff of literary acclaim. But she is not content to stand as a protagonist of heroic lore. She wishes also to create it.'),(116,'Witch Doctor','Intelligence','1660 at 25','51 - 61','1287 at 25','https://www.dotafire.com/images/hero/icon/witch-doctor.png','A wiry silhouette hitches forward--uneven of feature and limb, bizarre of gait, relentlessly criss-crossing the battlefield in search of that vital weak point where his talents can do most good, and most harm. Whether broken or mismade it is not clear, but still, none can doubt the power carried in his twisted physique. A long staff thumps the earth as the Witch Doctor advances, deploying a terrifying arsenal of fetishes, hexes and spells. It is a body of magical knowledge learned over several lifetimes in the island highlands of Prefectura, now wielded with precision accuracy against his enemies. Witch Doctor is your best friend, or your worst enemy--healing allies and laying waste to all who oppose him.'),(117,'Wraith King','Strength','2160 at 25','59 - 61','747 at 25','https://www.dotafire.com/images/hero/icon/wraith-king.png','For untold years, King Ostarion built a kingdom from the remains of his enemies. It was an obsessive\'s errand, done to pass the long eternities of a monarchy that seemed fated never to end. He believed that as long as he built up the towers of his palace, he could not die. But eventually he learned that he had been deluded...that bone itself could perish. Deeply mistrustful of flesh, he sought a more permanent way of extending his reign, and at last settled on pursuit of wraith energy, a form of pure spirit given off by certain dark souls at death. Should he infuse himself with Wraith Essence, he thought he might create a body as luminous and eternal as his ego. On the millennial solstice known as Wraith-Night, he submitted to a rite of transformation, compelling his subjects to harvest enough souls to fuel his ambition for immortality. No one knows how many of his champions died, for the only survivor who mattered was the Wraith King who rose with the sun on the following morn. Now he rarely spends a moment on his glowing throne--but strides out with sword drawn, demanding a fealty that extends far beyond death.'),(118,'Zeus','Intelligence','1620 at 25','54 - 62','1275 at 25','https://www.dotafire.com/images/hero/icon/zeus.png','Lord of Heaven, father of gods, Zeus treats all the Heroes as if they are his rambunctious, rebellious children. After being caught unnumbered times in the midst of trysts with countless mortal women, his divine wife finally gave him an ultimatum: \'If you love mortals so much, go and become one. If you can prove yourself faithful, then return to me as my immortal husband. Otherwise, go and die among your creatures.\' Zeus found her logic (and her magic) irrefutable, and agreed to her plan. He has been on his best behavior ever since, being somewhat fonder of immortality than he is of mortals. But to prove himself worthy of his eternal spouse, he must continue to pursue victory on the field of battle.'),(119,'Juggernaut','Agility','1660 at 25','52 - 56','639 at 25','https://www.dotafire.com/images/hero/icon/juggernaut.png','No one has ever seen the face hidden beneath the mask of Juggernaut. It is only speculation that he even has one. For defying a corrupt lord, he was exiled from the ancient Isle of Masks; a punishment that saved his life. The isle soon after vanished beneath the waves in a night of vengeful magic. He alone remains to carry on the Isle\'s long tradition of ritual and swordplay. The last practicioner of his art, Juggernaut\'s confidence and courage are the result of endless practice; his inventive bladework proves that he has never stopped challenging himself. Still, his motives are as unreadable as his expression. For a hero who has lost everything twice over, he fights as if victory is a foregone conclusion.'),(120,'Phantom Assassin','Agility','1660 at 25','49 - 51','651 at 25','https://www.dotafire.com/images/hero/icon/phantom-assassin.png','Through a process of divination, children are selected for upbringing by the Sisters of the Veil, an order that considers assassination a sacred part of the natural order. The Veiled Sisters identify targets through meditation and oracular utterances. They accept no contracts, and never seem to pursue targets for political or mercenary reasons. Their killings bear no relation to any recognizable agenda, and can seem to be completely random: A figure of great power is no more likely to be eliminated than a peasant or a well digger. Whatever pattern the killings may contain, it is known only to them. They treat their victims as sacrifices, and death at their hand is considered an honor. Raised with no identity except that of their order, any Phantom Assassin can take the place of any other; their number is not known. Perhaps there are many, perhaps there are few. Nothing is known of what lies under the Phantom Veil. Except that this one, from time to time, when none are near enough to hear, is known to stir her veils with the forbidden whisper of her own name: Mortred.'),(121,'Sniper','Agility','1380 at 25','40 - 46','999 at 25','https://www.dotafire.com/images/hero/icon/sniper.png','Kardel Sharpeye was born deep in the mountainous valleys of Knollen where, since time immemorial, the folk have survived by hunting the strange, cliff-dwelling steepstalkers above their village—killing them from a distance and collecting their carcasses where they fell. Sharpeye was among the best of these strange folk for whom projectile weapons are but another appendage, and to shoot is as natural as to touch.\n\nOn his day of summoning, when he was to gain full standing in his village, Sharpeye took the ancient test: a single shot from the valley floor to strike a beast down from the cliffs. To miss was to be dishonored. With his entire village standing vigil, Sharpeye took his shot. A steepstalker fell; the crowd cheered. But when the carcass was collected, the village grew silent, for the elders found that the bullet had pierced its glittering central eye then fallen to be clenched in the steepstalker\'s mandibles. This ominous sign was the literal opening of a dark prophecy, foretelling both greatness and exile for the gunman who made such a shot. Sharpeye the Sniper was thus, by his own skill, condemned to make his way apart from his people—and unwelcome back among them until he has fulfilled the remainder of the prophecy by attaining legendary stature on a field of battle.'),(122,'Drow Ranger','Agility','1440 at 25','48 - 59','651 at 25','https://www.dotafire.com/images/hero/icon/drow-ranger.png','Drow Ranger\'s given name is Traxex—a name well suited to the short, trollish, rather repulsive Drow people. But Traxex herself is not a Drow. Her parents were travelers in a caravan set upon by bandits, whose noisy slaughter of innocents roused the ire of the quiet Drow people. After the battle settled, the Drow discovered a small girl-child hiding in the ruined wagons, and agreed she could not be abandoned. Even as child, Traxex showed herself naturally adept at the arts they prized: Stealth, silence, subtlety. In spirit, if not in physique, she might have been a Drow changeling, returned to her proper home. But as she grew, she towered above her family and came to think of herself as ugly. After all, her features were smooth and symmetrical, entirely devoid of warts and coarse whiskers. Estranged from her adopted tribe, she withdrew to live alone in the woods. Lost travelers who find their way from the forest sometimes speak of an impossibly beautiful Ranger who peered at them from deep among the trees, then vanished like a dream before they could approach. Lithe and stealthy, icy hot, she moves like mist in silence. That whispering you hear is her frozen arrows finding an enemy\'s heart.'),(123,'Anti-Mage','Agility','1280 at 25','53 - 57','735 at 25','https://www.dotafire.com/images/hero/icon/anti-mage.png','The monks of Turstarkuri watched the rugged valleys below their mountain monastery as wave after wave of invaders swept through the lower kingdoms. Ascetic and pragmatic, in their remote monastic eyrie they remained aloof from mundane strife, wrapped in meditation that knew no gods or elements of magic. Then came the Legion of the Dead God, crusaders with a sinister mandate to replace all local worship with their Unliving Lord\'s poisonous nihilosophy. From a landscape that had known nothing but blood and battle for a thousand years, they tore the souls and bones of countless fallen legions and pitched them against Turstarkuri. The monastery stood scarcely a fortnight against the assault, and the few monks who bothered to surface from their meditations believed the invaders were but demonic visions sent to distract them from meditation. They died where they sat on their silken cushions. Only one youth survived--a pilgrim who had come as an acolyte, seeking wisdom, but had yet to be admitted to the monastery. He watched in horror as the monks to whom he had served tea and nettles were first slaughtered, then raised to join the ranks of the Dead God\'s priesthood. With nothing but a few of Turstarkuri\'s prized dogmatic scrolls, he crept away to the comparative safety of other lands, swearing to obliterate not only the Dead God\'s magic users--but to put an end to magic altogether.'),(124,'Invoker','Intelligence','1700 at 25','38 - 44','1563 at 25','https://www.dotafire.com/images/hero/icon/invoker.png','In its earliest, and some would say most potent form, magic was primarily the art of memory. It required no technology, no wands or appurtenances other than the mind of the magician. All the trappings of ritual were merely mnemonic devices, meant to allow the practitioner to recall in rich detail the specific mental formulae that unlocked a spell\'s power. The greatest mages in those days were the ones blessed with the greatest memories, and yet so complex were the invocations that all wizards were forced to specialize. The most devoted might hope in a lifetime to have adequate recollection of three spells—four at most. Ordinary wizards were content to know two, and it was not uncommon for a village mage to know only one—with even that requiring him to consult grimoires as an aid against forgetfulness on the rare occasions when he might be called to use it. But among these early practitioners there was one exception, a genius of vast intellect and prodigious memory who came to be known as the Invoker. In his youth, the precocious wizard mastered not four, not five, not even seven incantations: He could command no fewer than ten spells, and cast them instantly. Many more he learned but found useless, and would practice once then purge from his mind forever, to make room for more practical invocations. One such spell was the Sempiternal Cantrap—a longevity spell of such power that those who cast it in the world\'s first days are among us still (unless they have been crushed to atoms). Most of these quasi-immortals live quietly, afraid to admit their secret: But Invoker is not one to keep his gifts hidden. He is ancient, learned beyond all others, and his mind somehow still has space to contain an immense sense of his own worth...as well as the Invocations with which he amuses himself through the long slow twilight of the world\'s dying days.'),(125,'Bloodseeker','Agility','1960 at 25','57 - 63','771 at 25','https://www.dotafire.com/images/hero/icon/bloodseeker.png','Strygwyr the Bloodseeker is a ritually sanctioned hunter, Hound of the Flayed Twins, sent down from the mist-shrouded peaks of Xhacatocatl in search of blood. The Flayed Ones require oceanic amounts of blood to keep them sated and placated, and would soon drain their mountain empire of its populace if the priests of the high plateaus did not appease them. Strygwyr therefore goes out in search of carnage. The vital energy of any blood he lets, flows immediately to the Twins through the sacred markings on his weapons and armor. Over the years, he has come to embody the energy of a vicious hound; in battle he is savage as a jackal. Beneath the Mask of the Bloodseeker, in the rush of bloody quenching, it is said that you can sometime see the features of the Flayers taking direct possession of their Hound.'),(126,'Slark','Agility','1520 at 25','54 - 62','747 at 25','https://www.dotafire.com/images/hero/icon/slark.png','Little known to the inhabitants of the dry world, Dark Reef is a sunken prison where the worst of the sea-bred are sent for crimes against their fellows. It is a razor barbed warren full of murderous slithereen, treacherous Deep Ones, sociopathic meranths. In this dim labyrinth, patrolled by eels and guarded by enormous anemones, only the vicious survive. Pitched into Dark Reef for crimes unknown, Slark spent half a lifetime without kin or kindness, trusting no one, surviving through a combination of stealth and ruthlessness, keeping his thoughts and his plans to himself. When the infamous Dark Reef Dozen plotted their ill-fated breakout, they kept their plans a perfect secret, murdering anyone who could have put the pieces together–but somehow Slark discovered their scheme and made a place for himself in it. Ten of the Dozen died in the escape attempt, and two were captured, hauled back to Dark Reef, then executed for the entertainment of their fellow inmates. But Slark, the unsung thirteenth, used the commotion as cover and slipped away, never to be caught. Now a furtive resident of the carnivorous mangrove scrub that grips the southern reach of Shadeshore, Slark remains the only successful escapee from Dark Reef.'),(127,'Riki','Agility','1460 at 25','48 - 52','615 at 25','https://www.dotafire.com/images/hero/icon/riki.png','Riki was born middle child to the great dynasty of Tahlin. With an older brother groomed for the throne, and a younger brother coddled and kept, Riki, the small middle son, seemed born for the art of invisibility. It was an art he cultivated, and one which ultimately saved his life on the night that his people were betrayed and his family slaughtered. Of all the royal line, he alone escaped small and agile, unassuming, using smoke as cover. He cut his way out of the royal grounds, using the advantage of surprise, quietly slitting the throats of one enemy warrior after another. Now free of his royal responsibilities, Riki uses his talents in service to a new trade: stealth assassin. He silences his enemies, sharpening his skills, hoping to one day take revenge on those who killed his family and robbed him of his birthright.');

AGAINST syntax.\nMATCH() takes a comma-separated list that names the columns to be\nsearched. AGAINST takes a string to search for, and an optional\nmodifier that indicates what type of search to perform. The search\nstring must be a string value that is constant during query evaluation.\nThis rules out, for example, a table column because that can differ for\neach row.\n\nThere are three types of full-text searches:\n\no A natural language search interprets the search string as a phrase in\n  natural human language (a phrase in free text). There are no special\n  operators, with the exception of double quote (\") characters. The\n  stopword list applies. For more information about stopword lists, see\n  https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/fulltext-stopwords.html.\n\n  Full-text searches are natural language searches if the IN NATURAL\n  LANGUAGE MODE modifier is given or if no modifier is given. For more\n  information, see\n  https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/fulltext-natural-language.htm\n  l.\n\no A boolean search interprets the search string using the rules of a\n  special query language. The string contains the words to search for.\n  It can also contain operators that specify requirements such that a\n  word must be present or absent in matching rows, or that it should be\n  weighted higher or lower than usual. Certain common words (stopwords)\n  are omitted from the search index and do not match if present in the\n  search string. The IN BOOLEAN MODE modifier specifies a boolean\n  search. For more information, see\n  https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/fulltext-boolean.html.\n\no A query expansion search is a modification of a natural language\n  search. The search string is used to perform a natural language\n  search. Then words from the most relevant rows returned by the search\n  are added to the search string and the search is done again. The\n  query returns the rows from the second search. The IN NATURAL\n  LANGUAGE MODE WITH QUERY EXPANSION or WITH QUERY EXPANSION modifier\n  specifies a query expansion search. For more information, see\n  https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/fulltext-query-expansion.html\n  .\n\nURL: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/fulltext-search.html\n\n','mysql> SELECT id, body, MATCH (title,body) AGAINST\n    (\'Security implications of running MySQL as root\'\n    IN NATURAL LANGUAGE MODE) AS score\n    FROM articles WHERE MATCH (title,body) AGAINST\n    (\'Security implications of running MySQL as root\'\n    IN NATURAL LANGUAGE MODE);\n+----+-------------------------------------+-----------------+\n| id | body                                | score           |\n+----+-------------------------------------+-----------------+\n|  4 | 1.

While held by one session, other\nsessions cannot obtain a lock of the same name.\n\nReturns 1 if the lock was obtained successfully, 0 if the attempt timed\nout (for example, because another client has previously locked the\nname), or NULL if an error occurred (such as running out of memory or\nthe thread was killed with mysqladmin kill).\n\nA lock obtained with GET_LOCK() is released explicitly by executing\nRELEASE_LOCK() or implicitly when your session terminates (either\nnormally or abnormally). Locks obtained with GET_LOCK() are not\nreleased when transactions commit or roll back.\n\nIn MySQL 5.7, GET_LOCK() was reimplemented using the metadata locking\n(MDL) subsystem and its capabilities were extended. Multiple\nsimultaneous locks can be acquired and GET_LOCK() does not release any\nexisting locks.\n\nIt is even possible for a given session to acquire multiple locks for\nthe same name. Other sessions cannot acquire a lock with that name\nuntil the acquiring session releases all its locks for the name.\n\nAs a result of the MDL reimplementation, uniquely named locks acquired\nwith GET_LOCK() appear in the Performance Schema metadata_locks table.\nThe OBJECT_TYPE column says USER LEVEL LOCK and the OBJECT_NAME column\nindicates the lock name. In the case that multiple locks are acquired\nfor the same name, only the first lock for the name registers a row in\nthe metadata_locks table. Subsequent locks for the name increment a\ncounter in the lock but do not acquire additional metadata locks. The\nmetadata_locks row for the lock is deleted when the last lock instance\non the name is released.\n\nThe capability of acquiring multiple locks means there is the\npossibility of deadlock among clients. When this happens, the server\nchooses a caller and terminates its lock-acquisition request with an\nER_USER_LOCK_DEADLOCK error. This error does not cause transactions to\nroll back.\n\nBefore MySQL 5.7, only a single simultaneous lock can be acquired and\nGET_LOCK() releases any existing lock. The difference in lock\nacquisition behavior as of MySQL 5.7 can be seen by the following\nexample. Suppose that you execute these statements:\n\nSELECT GET_LOCK(\'lock1\',10);\nSELECT GET_LOCK(\'lock2\',10);\nSELECT RELEASE_LOCK(\'lock2\');\nSELECT RELEASE_LOCK(\'lock1\');\n\nIn MySQL 5.7 or later, the second GET_LOCK() acquires a second lock and\nboth RELEASE_LOCK() calls return 1 (success). Before MySQL 5.7, the\nsecond GET_LOCK() releases the first lock (\'lock1\') and the second\nRELEASE_LOCK() returns NULL (failure) because there is no \'lock1\' to\nrelease.\n\nMySQL 5.7 and later enforces a maximum length on lock names of 64\ncharacters. Previously, no limit was enforced.\n\nGET_LOCK() can be used to implement application locks or to simulate\nrecord locks. Names are locked on a server-wide basis. If a name has\nbeen locked within one session, GET_LOCK() blocks any request by\nanother session for a lock with the same name. This enables clients\nthat agree on a given lock name to use the name to perform cooperative\nadvisory locking. But be aware that it also enables a client that is\nnot among the set of cooperating clients to lock a name, either\ninadvertently or deliberately, and thus prevent any of the cooperating\nclients from locking that name. One way to reduce the likelihood of\nthis is to use lock names that are database-specific or\napplication-specific. For example, use lock names of the form\ndb_name.str or app_name.str.\n\nURL: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/locking-functions.html\n\n','','https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/locking-functions.html'),(260,'IS_FREE_LOCK',18,'Syntax:\nIS_FREE_LOCK(str)\n\nChecks whether the lock named str is free to use (that is, not locked).\nReturns 1 if the lock is free (no one is using the lock), 0 if the lock\nis in use, and NULL if an error occurs (such as an incorrect argument).\n\nURL: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/locking-functions.html\n\n','','https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/locking-functions.html'),(261,'IS_USED_LOCK',18,'Syntax:\nIS_USED_LOCK(str)\n\nChecks whether the lock named str is in use (that is, locked).

As a result, the address value for rows within each name group is\nnondeterministic. There are multiple ways to cause MySQL to accept the\nquery:\n\no Alter the table to make name a primary key or a unique NOT NULL\n  column. This enables MySQL to determine that address is functionally\n  dependent on name; that is, address is uniquely determined by name.\n  (This technique is inapplicable if NULL must be permitted as a valid\n  name value.)\n\no Use ANY_VALUE() to refer to address:\n\nSELECT name, ANY_VALUE(address), MAX(age) FROM t GROUP BY name;\n\n  In this case, MySQL ignores the nondeterminism of address values\n  within each name group and accepts the query. This may be useful if\n  you simply do not care which value of a nonaggregated column is\n  chosen for each group. ANY_VALUE() is not an aggregate function,\n  unlike functions such as SUM() or COUNT(). It simply acts to suppress\n  the test for nondeterminism.\n\no Disable ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY. This is equivalent to using ANY_VALUE()\n  with ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY enabled, as described in the previous item.\n\nANY_VALUE() is also useful if functional dependence exists between\ncolumns but MySQL cannot determine it. The following query is valid\nbecause age is functionally dependent on the grouping column age-1, but\nMySQL cannot tell that and rejects the query with ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY\nenabled:\n\nSELECT age FROM t GROUP BY age-1;\n\nTo cause MySQL to accept the query, use ANY_VALUE():\n\nSELECT ANY_VALUE(age) FROM t GROUP BY age-1;\n\nANY_VALUE() can be used for queries that refer to aggregate functions\nin the absence of a GROUP BY clause:\n\nmysql> SELECT name, MAX(age) FROM t;\nERROR 1140 (42000): In aggregated query without GROUP BY, expression\n#1 of SELECT list contains nonaggregated column \'mydb.t.name\'; this\nis incompatible with sql_mode=only_full_group_by\n\nWithout GROUP BY, there is a single group and it is nondeterministic\nwhich name value to choose for the group. ANY_VALUE() tells MySQL to\naccept the query:\n\nSELECT ANY_VALUE(name), MAX(age) FROM t;\n\nIt may be that, due to some property of a given data set, you know that\na selected nonaggregated column is effectively functionally dependent\non a GROUP BY column.

Both of these parameters are specified in bytes. You may\noptionally follow either or both of these with a one-letter\nabbreviation for an order of magnitude, similar to those used in\nmy.cnf. Generally, this is one of the letters M (for megabytes) or G\n(for gigabytes).\n\nMemory used for UNDO_BUFFER_SIZE comes from the global pool whose size\nis determined by the value of the SharedGlobalMemory data node\nconfiguration parameter.

For a FUNCTION, parameters are always regarded as IN\nparameters.\n\nAn IN parameter passes a value into a procedure. The procedure might\nmodify the value, but the modification is not visible to the caller\nwhen the procedure returns. An OUT parameter passes a value from the\nprocedure back to the caller. Its initial value is NULL within the\nprocedure, and its value is visible to the caller when the procedure\nreturns. An INOUT parameter is initialized by the caller, can be\nmodified by the procedure, and any change made by the procedure is\nvisible to the caller when the procedure returns.\n\nFor each OUT or INOUT parameter, pass a user-defined variable in the\nCALL statement that invokes the procedure so that you can obtain its\nvalue when the procedure returns. If you are calling the procedure from\nwithin another stored procedure or function, you can also pass a\nroutine parameter or local routine variable as an OUT or INOUT\nparameter. If you are calling the procedure from within a trigger, you\ncan also pass NEW.col_name as an OUT or INOUT parameter.\n\nFor information about the effect of unhandled conditions on procedure\nparameters, see\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/conditions-and-parameters.html.\n\nRoutine parameters cannot be referenced in statements prepared within\nthe routine; see\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/stored-program-restrictions.htm\nl.\n\nThe following example shows a simple stored procedure that uses an OUT\nparameter:\n\nmysql> delimiter //\n\nmysql> CREATE PROCEDURE simpleproc (OUT param1 INT)\n    -> BEGIN\n    ->   SELECT COUNT(*) INTO param1 FROM t;\n    -> END//\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)\n\nmysql> delimiter ;\n\nmysql> CALL simpleproc(@a);\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)\n\nmysql> SELECT @a;\n+------+\n| @a   |\n+------+\n| 3    |\n+------+\n1 row in set (0.00 sec)\n\nThe example uses the mysql client delimiter command to change the\nstatement delimiter from ; to // while the procedure is being defined.\nThis enables the ; delimiter used in the procedure body to be passed\nthrough to the server rather than being interpreted by mysql itself.\nSee\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/stored-programs-defining.html.\n\nThe RETURNS clause may be specified only for a FUNCTION, for which it\nis mandatory. It indicates the return type of the function, and the\nfunction body must contain a RETURN value statement. If the RETURN\nstatement returns a value of a different type, the value is coerced to\nthe proper type. For example, if a function specifies an ENUM or SET\nvalue in the RETURNS clause, but the RETURN statement returns an\ninteger, the value returned from the function is the string for the\ncorresponding ENUM member of set of SET members.\n\nThe following example function takes a parameter, performs an operation\nusing an SQL function, and returns the result. In this case, it is\nunnecessary to use delimiter because the function definition contains\nno internal ; statement delimiters:\n\nmysql> CREATE FUNCTION hello (s CHAR(20))\nmysql> RETURNS CHAR(50) DETERMINISTIC\n    -> RETURN CONCAT(\'Hello, \',s,\'!\');\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)\n\nmysql> SELECT hello(\'world\');\n+----------------+\n| hello(\'world\') |\n+----------------+\n| Hello, world!  |\n+----------------+\n1 row in set (0.00 sec)\n\nParameter types and function return types can be declared to use any\nvalid data type. The COLLATE attribute can be used if preceded by a\nCHARACTER SET specification.\n\nThe routine_body consists of a valid SQL routine statement. This can be\na simple statement such as SELECT or INSERT, or a compound statement\nwritten using BEGIN and END. Compound statements can contain\ndeclarations, loops, and other control structure statements. The syntax\nfor these statements is described in\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/sql-compound-statements.html.\nIn practice, stored functions tend to use compound statements, unless\nthe body consists of a single RETURN statement.\n\nMySQL permits routines to contain DDL statements, such as CREATE and\nDROP. MySQL also permits stored procedures (but not stored functions)\nto contain SQL transaction statements such as COMMIT. Stored functions\nmay not contain statements that perform explicit or implicit commit or\nrollback. Support for these statements is not required by the SQL\nstandard, which states that each DBMS vendor may decide whether to\npermit them.\n\nStatements that return a result set can be used within a stored\nprocedure but not within a stored function. This prohibition includes\nSELECT statements that do not have an INTO var_list clause and other\nstatements such as SHOW, EXPLAIN, and CHECK TABLE. For statements that\ncan be determined at function definition time to return a result set, a\nNot allowed to return a result set from a function error occurs\n(ER_SP_NO_RETSET). For statements that can be determined only at\nruntime to return a result set, a PROCEDURE %s can\'t return a result\nset in the given context error occurs (ER_SP_BADSELECT).\n\nUSE statements within stored routines are not permitted. When a routine\nis invoked, an implicit USE db_name is performed (and undone when the\nroutine terminates). The causes the routine to have the given default\ndatabase while it executes. References to objects in databases other\nthan the routine default database should be qualified with the\nappropriate database name.\n\nFor additional information about statements that are not permitted in\nstored routines, see\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/stored-program-restrictions.htm\nl.\n\nFor information about invoking stored procedures from within programs\nwritten in a language that has a MySQL interface, see [HELP CALL].\n\nMySQL stores the sql_mode system variable setting in effect when a\nroutine is created or altered, and always executes the routine with\nthis setting in force, regardless of the current server SQL mode when\nthe routine begins executing.\n\nThe switch from the SQL mode of the invoker to that of the routine\noccurs after evaluation of arguments and assignment of the resulting\nvalues to routine parameters. If you define a routine in strict SQL\nmode but invoke it in nonstrict mode, assignment of arguments to\nroutine parameters does not take place in strict mode. If you require\nthat expressions passed to a routine be assigned in strict SQL mode,\nyou should invoke the routine with strict mode in effect.\n\nURL: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/create-procedure.html\n\n','','https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/create-procedure.html'),(504,'CREATE FUNCTION',33,'Syntax:\nCREATE\n    [DEFINER = user]\n    PROCEDURE sp_name ([proc_parameter[,...]])\n    [characteristic ...] routine_body\n\nCREATE\n    [DEFINER = user]\n    FUNCTION sp_name ([func_parameter[,...]])\n    RETURNS type\n    [characteristic ...] routine_body\n\nproc_parameter:\n    [ IN | OUT | INOUT ] param_name type\n\nfunc_parameter:\n    param_name type\n\ntype:\n    Any valid MySQL data type\n\ncharacteristic:\n    COMMENT \'string\'\n  | LANGUAGE SQL\n  | [NOT] DETERMINISTIC\n  | { CONTAINS SQL | NO SQL | READS SQL DATA | MODIFIES SQL DATA }\n  | SQL SECURITY { DEFINER | INVOKER }\n\nroutine_body:\n    Valid SQL routine statement\n\nThese statements create stored routines. By default, a routine is\nassociated with the default database. To associate the routine\nexplicitly with a given database, specify the name as db_name.sp_name\nwhen you create it.\n\nThe CREATE FUNCTION statement is also used in MySQL to support UDFs\n(user-defined functions). See\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/adding-functions.html. A UDF\ncan be regarded as an external stored function. Stored functions share\ntheir namespace with UDFs. See\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/function-resolution.html, for\nthe rules describing how the server interprets references to different\nkinds of functions.\n\nTo invoke a stored procedure, use the CALL statement (see [HELP CALL]).\nTo invoke a stored function, refer to it in an expression. The function\nreturns a value during expression evaluation.\n\nCREATE PROCEDURE and CREATE FUNCTION require the CREATE ROUTINE\nprivilege. If the DEFINER clause is present, the privileges required\ndepend on the user value, as discussed in\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/stored-objects-security.html.\nIf binary logging is enabled, CREATE FUNCTION might require the SUPER\nprivilege, as discussed in\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/stored-programs-logging.html.\n\nBy default, MySQL automatically grants the ALTER ROUTINE and EXECUTE\nprivileges to the routine creator. This behavior can be changed by\ndisabling the automatic_sp_privileges system variable. See\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/stored-routines-privileges.html\n.\n\nThe DEFINER and SQL SECURITY clauses specify the security context to be\nused when checking access privileges at routine execution time, as\ndescribed later in this section.\n\nIf the routine name is the same as the name of a built-in SQL function,\na syntax error occurs unless you use a space between the name and the\nfollowing parenthesis when defining the routine or invoking it later.\nFor this reason, avoid using the names of existing SQL functions for\nyour own stored routines.\n\nThe IGNORE_SPACE SQL mode applies to built-in functions, not to stored\nroutines. It is always permissible to have spaces after a stored\nroutine name, regardless of whether IGNORE_SPACE is enabled.\n\nThe parameter list enclosed within parentheses must always be present.\nIf there are no parameters, an empty parameter list of () should be\nused. Parameter names are not case-sensitive.\n\nEach parameter is an IN parameter by default. To specify otherwise for\na parameter, use the keyword OUT or INOUT before the parameter name.\n\n*Note*:\n\nSpecifying a parameter as IN, OUT, or INOUT is valid only for a\nPROCEDURE. For a FUNCTION, parameters are always regarded as IN\nparameters.\n\nAn IN parameter passes a value into a procedure. The procedure might\nmodify the value, but the modification is not visible to the caller\nwhen the procedure returns. An OUT parameter passes a value from the\nprocedure back to the caller. Its initial value is NULL within the\nprocedure, and its value is visible to the caller when the procedure\nreturns. An INOUT parameter is initialized by the caller, can be\nmodified by the procedure, and any change made by the procedure is\nvisible to the caller when the procedure returns.\n\nFor each OUT or INOUT parameter, pass a user-defined variable in the\nCALL statement that invokes the procedure so that you can obtain its\nvalue when the procedure returns. If you are calling the procedure from\nwithin another stored procedure or function, you can also pass a\nroutine parameter or local routine variable as an OUT or INOUT\nparameter.

For\nmore information, see\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/general-tablespaces.html.\n\nConsiderations for NDB Cluster\n\nThis statement is used to create a tablespace, which can contain one or\nmore data files, providing storage space for NDB Cluster Disk Data\ntables (see\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/mysql-cluster-disk-data.html).\nOne data file is created and added to the tablespace using this\nstatement. Additional data files may be added to the tablespace by\nusing the ALTER TABLESPACE statement (see [HELP ALTER TABLESPACE]).\n\n*Note*:\n\nAll NDB Cluster Disk Data objects share the same namespace. This means\nthat each Disk Data object must be uniquely named (and not merely each\nDisk Data object of a given type). For example, you cannot have a\ntablespace and a log file group with the same name, or a tablespace and\na data file with the same name.\n\nA log file group of one or more UNDO log files must be assigned to the\ntablespace to be created with the USE LOGFILE GROUP clause.\nlogfile_group must be an existing log file group created with CREATE\nLOGFILE GROUP (see [HELP CREATE LOGFILE GROUP]). Multiple tablespaces\nmay use the same log file group for UNDO logging.\n\nWhen setting EXTENT_SIZE or INITIAL_SIZE, you may optionally follow the\nnumber with a one-letter abbreviation for an order of magnitude,\nsimilar to those used in my.cnf. Generally, this is one of the letters\nM (for megabytes) or G (for gigabytes).\n\nINITIAL_SIZE and EXTENT_SIZE are subject to rounding as follows:\n\no EXTENT_SIZE is rounded up to the nearest whole multiple of 32K.\n\no INITIAL_SIZE is rounded down to the nearest whole multiple of 32K;\n  this result is rounded up to the nearest whole multiple of\n  EXTENT_SIZE (after any rounding).\n\nThe rounding just described is done explicitly, and a warning is issued\nby the MySQL Server when any such rounding is performed. The rounded\nvalues are also used by the NDB kernel for calculating\nINFORMATION_SCHEMA.FILES column values and other purposes. However, to\navoid an unexpected result, we suggest that you always use whole\nmultiples of 32K in specifying these options.\n\nWhen CREATE TABLESPACE is used with ENGINE [=] NDB, a tablespace and\nassociated data file are created on each Cluster data node. You can\nverify that the data files were created and obtain information about\nthem by querying the INFORMATION_SCHEMA.FILES table. (See the example\nlater in this section.)\n\n(See https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/files-table.html.)\n\nOptions\n\no ADD DATAFILE: Defines the name of a tablespace data file; this option\n  is always required. An InnoDB tablespace supports only a single data\n  file, whose name must include a .ibd extension. An NDB Cluster\n  tablespace supports multiple data files which can have any legal file\n  names; more data files can be added to an NDB Cluster tablespace\n  following its creation by using an ALTER TABLESPACE statement.\n\n  *Note*:\n\n  ALTER TABLESPACE is not supported by InnoDB.\n\n  To place the data file in a location outside of the data directory\n  (datadir), include an absolute directory path or a path relative to\n  the data directory. If you do not specify a path, the tablespace is\n  created in the data directory. An isl file is created in the data\n  directory when an InnoDB tablespace is created outside of the data\n  directory.\n\n  To avoid conflicts with implicitly created file-per-table\n  tablespaces, creating a general tablespace in a subdirectory under\n  the data directory is not supported. When creating a general\n  tablespace outside of the data directory, the directory must exist\n  prior to creating the tablespace.\n\n  The file_name, including any specified path, must be quoted with\n  single or double quotations marks. File names (not counting the file\n  extension) and directory names must be at least one byte in length.\n  Zero length file names and directory names are not supported.\n\no FILE_BLOCK_SIZE: This option---which is specific to InnoDB, and is\n  ignored by NDB---defines the block size for the tablespace data file.\n  Values can be specified in bytes or kilobytes. For example, an 8\n  kilobyte file block size can be specified as 8192 or 8K. If you do\n  not specify this option, FILE_BLOCK_SIZE defaults to the\n  innodb_page_size value. FILE_BLOCK_SIZE is required when you intend\n  to use the tablespace for storing compressed InnoDB tables\n  (ROW_FORMAT=COMPRESSED). In this case, you must define the tablespace\n  FILE_BLOCK_SIZE when creating the tablespace.\n\n  If FILE_BLOCK_SIZE is equal the innodb_page_size value, the\n  tablespace can contain only tables having an uncompressed row format\n  (COMPACT, REDUNDANT, and DYNAMIC). Tables with a COMPRESSED row\n  format have a different physical page size than uncompressed tables.\n  Therefore, compressed tables cannot coexist in the same tablespace as\n  uncompressed tables.\n\n  For a general tablespace to contain compressed tables,\n  FILE_BLOCK_SIZE must be specified, and the FILE_BLOCK_SIZE value must\n  be a valid compressed page size in relation to the innodb_page_size\n  value. Also, the physical page size of the compressed table\n  (KEY_BLOCK_SIZE) must be equal to FILE_BLOCK_SIZE/1024. For example,\n  if innodb_page_size=16K, and FILE_BLOCK_SIZE=8K, the KEY_BLOCK_SIZE\n  of the table must be 8. For more information, see\n  https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/general-tablespaces.html.\n\no USE LOGFILE GROUP: Required for NDB, this is the name of a log file\n  group previously created using CREATE LOGFILE GROUP. Not supported\n  for InnoDB, where it fails with an error.\n\no EXTENT_SIZE: This option is specific to NDB, and is not supported by\n  InnoDB, where it fails with an error. EXTENT_SIZE sets the size, in\n  bytes, of the extents used by any files belonging to the tablespace.\n  The default value is 1M. The minimum size is 32K, and theoretical\n  maximum is 2G, although the practical maximum size depends on a\n  number of factors. In most cases, changing the extent size does not\n  have any measurable effect on performance, and the default value is\n  recommended for all but the most unusual situations.\n\n  An extent is a unit of disk space allocation. One extent is filled\n  with as much data as that extent can contain before another extent is\n  used. In theory, up to 65,535 (64K) extents may used per data file;\n  however, the recommended maximum is 32,768 (32K). The recommended\n  maximum size for a single data file is 32G---that is, 32K extents x 1\n  MB per extent. In addition, once an extent is allocated to a given\n  partition, it cannot be used to store data from a different\n  partition; an extent cannot store data from more than one partition.\n  This means, for example that a tablespace having a single datafile\n  whose INITIAL_SIZE (described in the following item) is 256 MB and\n  whose EXTENT_SIZE is 128M has just two extents, and so can be used to\n  store data from at most two different disk data table partitions.\n\n  You can see how many extents remain free in a given data file by\n  querying the INFORMATION_SCHEMA.FILES table, and so derive an\n  estimate for how much space remains free in the file. For further\n  discussion and examples, see\n  https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/files-table.html.\n\no INITIAL_SIZE: This option is specific to NDB, and is not supported by\n  InnoDB, where it fails with an error.\n\n  The INITIAL_SIZE parameter sets the total size in bytes of the data\n  file that was specific using ADD DATATFILE. Once this file has been\n  created, its size cannot be changed; however, you can add more data\n  files to the tablespace using ALTER TABLESPACE ... ADD DATAFILE.\n\n  INITIAL_SIZE is optional; its default value is 134217728 (128 MB).\n\n  On 32-bit systems, the maximum supported value for INITIAL_SIZE is\n  4294967296 (4 GB).\n\no AUTOEXTEND_SIZE: Currently ignored by MySQL; reserved for possible\n  future use. Has no effect in any release of MySQL 5.7 or MySQL NDB\n  Cluster 7.5, regardless of the storage engine used.\n\no MAX_SIZE: Currently ignored by MySQL; reserved for possible future\n  use. Has no effect in any release of MySQL 5.7 or MySQL NDB Cluster\n  7.5, regardless of the storage engine used.\n\no NODEGROUP: Currently ignored by MySQL; reserved for possible future\n  use.

Has no effect in any release of MySQL 5.7 or MySQL NDB Cluster\n  7.5, regardless of the storage engine used.\n\no ENGINE: Defines the storage engine which uses the tablespace, where\n  engine_name is the name of the storage engine. Currently, only the\n  InnoDB storage engine is supported by standard MySQL 5.7 releases.\n  MySQL NDB Cluster 7.5 supports both NDB and InnoDB tablespaces. The\n  value of the default_storage_engine system variable is used for\n  ENGINE if the option is not specified.\n\nNotes\n\no For the rules covering the naming of MySQL tablespaces, see\n  https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/identifiers.html. In addition\n  to these rules, the slash character (\"/\") is not permitted, nor can\n  you use names beginning with innodb_, as this prefix is reserved for\n  system use.\n\no Tablespaces do not support temporary tables.\n\no innodb_file_per_table, innodb_file_format, and innodb_file_format_max\n  settings have no influence on CREATE TABLESPACE operations.\n  innodb_file_per_table does not need to be enabled. General\n  tablespaces support all table row formats regardless of file format\n  settings. Likewise, general tablespaces support the addition of\n  tables of any row format using CREATE TABLE ... TABLESPACE,\n  regardless of file format settings.\n\no innodb_strict_mode is not applicable to general tablespaces.\n  Tablespace management rules are strictly enforced independently of\n  innodb_strict_mode. If CREATE TABLESPACE parameters are incorrect or\n  incompatible, the operation fails regardless of the\n  innodb_strict_mode setting. When a table is added to a general\n  tablespace using CREATE TABLE ... TABLESPACE or ALTER TABLE ...\n  TABLESPACE, innodb_strict_mode is ignored but the statement is\n  evaluated as if innodb_strict_mode is enabled.\n\no Use DROP TABLESPACE to remove a tablespace. All tables must be\n  dropped from a tablespace using DROP TABLE prior to dropping the\n  tablespace. Before dropping an NDB Cluster tablespace you must also\n  remove all its data files using one or more ALTER TABLESPACE ... DROP\n  DATATFILE statements. See\n  https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/mysql-cluster-disk-data-objec\n  ts.html.\n\no All parts of an InnoDB table added to an InnoDB general tablespace\n  reside in the general tablespace, including indexes and BLOB pages.\n\n  For an NDB table assigned to a tablespace, only those columns which\n  are not indexed are stored on disk, and actually use the tablespace\n  data files. Indexes and indexed columns for all NDB tables are always\n  kept in memory.\n\no Similar to the system tablespace, truncating or dropping tables\n  stored in a general tablespace creates free space internally in the\n  general tablespace .ibd data file which can only be used for new\n  InnoDB data. Space is not released back to the operating system as it\n  is for file-per-table tablespaces.\n\no A general tablespace is not associated with any database or schema.\n\no ALTER TABLE ... DISCARD TABLESPACE and ALTER TABLE ...IMPORT\n  TABLESPACE are not supported for tables that belong to a general\n  tablespace.\n\no The server uses tablespace-level metadata locking for DDL that\n  references general tablespaces. By comparison, the server uses\n  table-level metadata locking for DDL that references file-per-table\n  tablespaces.\n\no A generated or existing tablespace cannot be changed to a general\n  tablespace.\n\no Tables stored in a general tablespace can only be opened in MySQL\n  5.7.6 or later due to the addition of new table flags.\n\no There is no conflict between general tablespace names and\n  file-per-table tablespace names. The \"/\" character, which is present\n  in file-per-table tablespace names, is not permitted in general\n  tablespace names.\n\no mysqldump and mysqlpump do not dump InnoDB CREATE TABLESPACE\n  statements.\n\nInnoDB Examples\n\nThis example demonstrates creating a general tablespace and adding\nthree uncompressed tables of different row formats.\n\nmysql> CREATE TABLESPACE `ts1` ADD DATAFILE \'ts1.ibd\' ENGINE=INNODB;\n\nmysql> CREATE TABLE t1 (c1 INT PRIMARY KEY) TABLESPACE ts1 ROW_FORMAT=REDUNDANT;\n\nmysql> CREATE TABLE t2 (c1 INT PRIMARY KEY) TABLESPACE ts1 ROW_FORMAT=COMPACT;\n\nmysql> CREATE TABLE t3 (c1 INT PRIMARY KEY) TABLESPACE ts1 ROW_FORMAT=DYNAMIC;\n\nThis example demonstrates creating a general tablespace and adding a\ncompressed table. The example assumes a default innodb_page_size value\nof 16K. The FILE_BLOCK_SIZE of 8192 requires that the compressed table\nhave a KEY_BLOCK_SIZE of 8.\n\nmysql> CREATE TABLESPACE `ts2` ADD DATAFILE \'ts2.ibd\' FILE_BLOCK_SIZE = 8192 Engine=InnoDB;\n\nmysql> CREATE TABLE t4 (c1 INT PRIMARY KEY) TABLESPACE ts2 ROW_FORMAT=COMPRESSED KEY_BLOCK_SIZE=8;\n\nNDB Example\n\nSuppose that you wish to create an NDB Cluster Disk Data tablespace\nnamed myts using a datafile named mydata-1.dat. An NDB tablespace\nalways requires the use of a log file group consisting of one or more\nundo log files. For this example, we first create a log file group\nnamed mylg that contains one undo long file named myundo-1.dat, using\nthe CREATE LOGFILE GROUP statement shown here:\n\nmysql> CREATE LOGFILE GROUP myg1\n    ->     ADD UNDOFILE \'myundo-1.dat\'\n    ->     ENGINE=NDB;\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected (3.29 sec)\n\nNow you can create the tablespace previously described using the\nfollowing statement:\n\nmysql> CREATE TABLESPACE myts\n    ->     ADD DATAFILE \'mydata-1.dat\'\n    ->     USE LOGFILE GROUP mylg\n    ->     ENGINE=NDB;\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected (2.98 sec)\n\nYou can now create a Disk Data table using a CREATE TABLE statement\nwith the TABLESPACE and STORAGE DISK options, similar to what is shown\nhere:\n\nmysql> CREATE TABLE mytable (\n    ->     id INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,\n    ->     lname VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,\n    ->     fname VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,\n    ->     dob DATE NOT NULL,\n    ->     joined DATE NOT NULL,\n    ->     INDEX(last_name, first_name)\n    -> )\n    ->     TABLESPACE myts STORAGE DISK\n    ->     ENGINE=NDB;\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected (1.41 sec)\n\nIt is important to note that only the dob and joined columns from\nmytable are actually stored on disk, due to the fact that the id,\nlname, and fname columns are all indexed.\n\nAs mentioned previously, when CREATE TABLESPACE is used with ENGINE [=]\nNDB, a tablespace and associated data file are created on each NDB\nCluster data node. You can verify that the data files were created and\nobtain information about them by querying the INFORMATION_SCHEMA.FILES\ntable, as shown here:\n\nmysql> SELECT FILE_NAME, FILE_TYPE, LOGFILE_GROUP_NAME, STATUS, EXTRA\n    ->     FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.FILES\n    ->     WHERE TABLESPACE_NAME = \'myts\';\n\n+--------------+------------+--------------------+--------+----------------+\n| file_name    | file_type  | logfile_group_name | status | extra          |\n+--------------+------------+--------------------+--------+----------------+\n| mydata-1.dat | DATAFILE   | mylg               | NORMAL | CLUSTER_NODE=5 |\n| mydata-1.dat | DATAFILE   | mylg               | NORMAL | CLUSTER_NODE=6 |\n| NULL         | TABLESPACE | mylg               | NORMAL | NULL           |\n+--------------+------------+--------------------+--------+----------------+\n3 rows in set (0.01 sec)\n\nFor additional information and examples, see\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/mysql-cluster-disk-data-objects\n.html.\n\nURL: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/create-tablespace.html\n\n','','https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/create-tablespace.html'),(509,'CREATE TRIGGER',33,'Syntax:\nCREATE\n    [DEFINER = user]\n    TRIGGER trigger_name\n    trigger_time trigger_event\n    ON tbl_name FOR EACH ROW\n    [trigger_order]\n    trigger_body\n\ntrigger_time: { BEFORE | AFTER }\n\ntrigger_event: { INSERT | UPDATE | DELETE }\n\ntrigger_order: { FOLLOWS | PRECEDES } other_trigger_name\n\nThis statement creates a new trigger. A trigger is a named database\nobject that is associated with a table, and that activates when a\nparticular event occurs for the table. The trigger becomes associated\nwith the table named tbl_name, which must refer to a permanent table.\nYou cannot associate a trigger with a TEMPORARY table or a view.\n\nTrigger names exist in the schema namespace, meaning that all triggers\nmust have unique names within a schema. Triggers in different schemas\ncan have the same name.\n\nThis section describes CREATE TRIGGER syntax. For additional\ndiscussion, see\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/trigger-syntax.html.\n\nCREATE TRIGGER requires the TRIGGER privilege for the table associated\nwith the trigger. If the DEFINER clause is present, the privileges\nrequired depend on the user value, as discussed in\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/stored-objects-security.html.\nIf binary logging is enabled, CREATE TRIGGER might require the SUPER\nprivilege, as discussed in\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/stored-programs-logging.html.\n\nThe DEFINER clause determines the security context to be used when\nchecking access privileges at trigger activation time, as described\nlater in this section.\n\ntrigger_time is the trigger action time. It can be BEFORE or AFTER to\nindicate that the trigger activates before or after each row to be\nmodified.\n\nBasic column value checks occur prior to trigger activation, so you\ncannot use BEFORE triggers to convert values inappropriate for the\ncolumn type to valid values.\n\ntrigger_event indicates the kind of operation that activates the\ntrigger. These trigger_event values are permitted:\n\no INSERT: The trigger activates whenever a new row is inserted into the\n  table (for example, through INSERT, LOAD DATA, and REPLACE\n  statements).\n\no UPDATE: The trigger activates whenever a row is modified (for\n  example, through UPDATE statements).\n\no DELETE: The trigger activates whenever a row is deleted from the\n  table (for example, through DELETE and REPLACE statements). DROP\n  TABLE and TRUNCATE TABLE statements on the table do not activate this\n  trigger, because they do not use DELETE. Dropping a partition does\n  not activate DELETE triggers, either.\n\nURL: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/create-trigger.html\n\n','','https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/create-trigger.html'),(510,'CREATE VIEW',33,'Syntax:\nCREATE\n    [OR REPLACE]\n    [ALGORITHM = {UNDEFINED | MERGE | TEMPTABLE}]\n    [DEFINER = user]\n    [SQL SECURITY { DEFINER | INVOKER }]\n    VIEW view_name [(column_list)]\n    AS select_statement\n    [WITH [CASCADED | LOCAL] CHECK OPTION]\n\nThe CREATE VIEW statement creates a new view, or replaces an existing\nview if the OR REPLACE clause is given. If the view does not exist,\nCREATE OR REPLACE VIEW is the same as CREATE VIEW. If the view does\nexist, CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW replaces it.\n\nFor information about restrictions on view use, see\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/view-restrictions.html.\n\nThe select_statement is a SELECT statement that provides the definition\nof the view. (Selecting from the view selects, in effect, using the\nSELECT statement.) The select_statement can select from base tables or\nother views.\n\nThe view definition is \"frozen\" at creation time and is not affected by\nsubsequent changes to the definitions of the underlying tables. For\nexample, if a view is defined as SELECT * on a table, new columns added\nto the table later do not become part of the view, and columns dropped\nfrom the table will result in an error when selecting from the view.\n\nThe ALGORITHM clause affects how MySQL processes the view. The DEFINER\nand SQL SECURITY clauses specify the security context to be used when\nchecking access privileges at view invocation time. The WITH CHECK\nOPTION clause can be given to constrain inserts or updates to rows in\ntables referenced by the view. These clauses are described later in\nthis section.\n\nThe CREATE VIEW statement requires the CREATE VIEW privilege for the\nview, and some privilege for each column selected by the SELECT\nstatement. For columns used elsewhere in the SELECT statement, you must\nhave the SELECT privilege. If the OR REPLACE clause is present, you\nmust also have the DROP privilege for the view. If the DEFINER clause\nis present, the privileges required depend on the user value, as\ndiscussed in\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/stored-objects-security.html.\n\nWhen a view is referenced, privilege checking occurs as described later\nin this section.\n\nA view belongs to a database. By default, a new view is created in the\ndefault database. To create the view explicitly in a given database,\nuse db_name.view_name syntax to qualify the view name with the database\nname:\n\nCREATE VIEW test.v AS SELECT * FROM t;\n\nUnqualified table or view names in the SELECT statement are also\ninterpreted with respect to the default database. A view can refer to\ntables or views in other databases by qualifying the table or view name\nwith the appropriate database name.\n\nWithin a database, base tables and views share the same namespace, so a\nbase table and a view cannot have the same name.\n\nColumns retrieved by the SELECT statement can be simple references to\ntable columns, or expressions that use functions, constant values,\noperators, and so forth.\n\nA view must have unique column names with no duplicates, just like a\nbase table. By default, the names of the columns retrieved by the\nSELECT statement are used for the view column names. To define explicit\nnames for the view columns, specify the optional column_list clause as\na list of comma-separated identifiers. The number of names in\ncolumn_list must be the same as the number of columns retrieved by the\nSELECT statement.\n\nA view can be created from many kinds of SELECT statements. It can\nrefer to base tables or other views. It can use joins, UNION, and\nsubqueries. The SELECT need not even refer to any tables:\n\nCREATE VIEW v_today (today) AS SELECT CURRENT_DATE;\n\nThe following example defines a view that selects two columns from\nanother table as well as an expression calculated from those columns:\n\nmysql> CREATE TABLE t (qty INT, price INT);\nmysql> INSERT INTO t VALUES(3, 50);\nmysql> CREATE VIEW v AS SELECT qty, price, qty*price AS value FROM t;\nmysql> SELECT * FROM v;\n+------+-------+-------+\n| qty  | price | value |\n+------+-------+-------+\n|    3 |    50 |   150 |\n+------+-------+-------+\n\nA view definition is subject to the following restrictions:\n\no The SELECT statement cannot refer to system variables or user-defined\n  variables.\n\no Within a stored program, the SELECT statement cannot refer to program\n  parameters or local variables.\n\no The SELECT statement cannot refer to prepared statement parameters.\n\no Any table or view referred to in the definition must exist. If, after\n  the view has been created, a table or view that the definition refers\n  to is dropped, use of the view results in an error. To check a view\n  definition for problems of this kind, use the CHECK TABLE statement.\n\no The definition cannot refer to a TEMPORARY table, and you cannot\n  create a TEMPORARY view.\n\no You cannot associate a trigger with a view.\n\no Aliases for column names in the SELECT statement are checked against\n  the maximum column length of 64 characters (not the maximum alias\n  length of 256 characters).\n\nORDER BY is permitted in a view definition, but it is ignored if you\nselect from a view using a statement that has its own ORDER BY.\n\nFor other options or clauses in the definition, they are added to the\noptions or clauses of the statement that references the view, but the\neffect is undefined. For example, if a view definition includes a LIMIT\nclause, and you select from the view using a statement that has its own\nLIMIT clause, it is undefined which limit applies. This same principle\napplies to options such as ALL, DISTINCT, or SQL_SMALL_RESULT that\nfollow the SELECT keyword, and to clauses such as INTO, FOR UPDATE,\nLOCK IN SHARE MODE, and PROCEDURE.\n\nThe results obtained from a view may be affected if you change the\nquery processing environment by changing system variables:\n\nmysql> CREATE VIEW v (mycol) AS SELECT \'abc\';\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)\n\nmysql> SET sql_mode = \'\';\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)\n\nmysql> SELECT \"mycol\" FROM v;\n+-------+\n| mycol |\n+-------+\n| mycol |\n+-------+\n1 row in set (0.01 sec)\n\nmysql> SET sql_mode = \'ANSI_QUOTES\';\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)\n\nmysql> SELECT \"mycol\" FROM v;\n+-------+\n| mycol |\n+-------+\n| abc   |\n+-------+\n1 row in set (0.00 sec)\n\nThe DEFINER and SQL SECURITY clauses determine which MySQL account to\nuse when checking access privileges for the view when a statement is\nexecuted that references the view. The valid SQL SECURITY\ncharacteristic values are DEFINER (the default) and INVOKER. These\nindicate that the required privileges must be held by the user who\ndefined or invoked the view, respectively.\n\nIf the DEFINER clause is present, the user value should be a MySQL\naccount specified as \'user_name\'@\'host_name\', CURRENT_USER, or\nCURRENT_USER(). The permitted user values depend on the privileges you\nhold, as discussed in\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/stored-objects-security.html.\nAlso see that section for additional information about view security.\n\nIf the DEFINER clause is omitted, the default definer is the user who\nexecutes the CREATE VIEW statement. This is the same as specifying\nDEFINER = CURRENT_USER explicitly.\n\nWithin a view definition, the CURRENT_USER function returns the view\'s\nDEFINER value by default. For views defined with the SQL SECURITY\nINVOKER characteristic, CURRENT_USER returns the account for the view\'s\ninvoker. For information about user auditing within views, see\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/account-activity-auditing.html.\n\nWithin a stored routine that is defined with the SQL SECURITY DEFINER\ncharacteristic, CURRENT_USER returns the routine\'s DEFINER value. This\nalso affects a view defined within such a routine, if the view\ndefinition contains a DEFINER value of CURRENT_USER.\n\nMySQL checks view privileges like this:\n\no At view definition time, the view creator must have the privileges\n  needed to use the top-level objects accessed by the view. For\n  example, if the view definition refers to table columns, the creator\n  must have some privilege for each column in the select list of the\n  definition, and the SELECT privilege for each column used elsewhere\n  in the definition. If the definition refers to a stored function,\n  only the privileges needed to invoke the function can be checked. The\n  privileges required at function invocation time can be checked only\n  as it executes: For different invocations, different execution paths\n  within the function might be taken.\n\no The user who references a view must have appropriate privileges to\n  access it (SELECT to select from it, INSERT to insert into it, and so\n  forth.)\n\no When a view has been referenced, privileges for objects accessed by\n  the view are checked against the privileges held by the view DEFINER\n  account or invoker, depending on whether the SQL SECURITY\n  characteristic is DEFINER or INVOKER, respectively.\n\no If reference to a view causes execution of a stored function,\n  privilege checking for statements executed within the function depend\n  on whether the function SQL SECURITY characteristic is DEFINER or\n  INVOKER. If the security characteristic is DEFINER, the function runs\n  with the privileges of the DEFINER account. If the characteristic is\n  INVOKER, the function runs with the privileges determined by the\n  view\'s SQL SECURITY characteristic.\n\nExample: A view might depend on a stored function, and that function\nmight invoke other stored routines. For example, the following view\ninvokes a stored function f():\n\nCREATE VIEW v AS SELECT * FROM t WHERE t.id = f(t.name);\n\nSuppose that f() contains a statement such as this:\n\nIF name IS NULL then\n  CALL p1();\nELSE\n  CALL p2();\nEND IF;\n\nThe privileges required for executing statements within f() need to be\nchecked when f() executes. This might mean that privileges are needed\nfor p1() or p2(), depending on the execution path within f(). Those\nprivileges must be checked at runtime, and the user who must possess\nthe privileges is determined by the SQL SECURITY values of the view v\nand the function f().\n\nThe DEFINER and SQL SECURITY clauses for views are extensions to\nstandard SQL. In standard SQL, views are handled using the rules for\nSQL SECURITY DEFINER. The standard says that the definer of the view,\nwhich is the same as the owner of the view\'s schema, gets applicable\nprivileges on the view (for example, SELECT) and may grant them. MySQL\nhas no concept of a schema \"owner\", so MySQL adds a clause to identify\nthe definer. The DEFINER clause is an extension where the intent is to\nhave what the standard has; that is, a permanent record of who defined\nthe view. This is why the default DEFINER value is the account of the\nview creator.\n\nThe optional ALGORITHM clause is a MySQL extension to standard SQL. It\naffects how MySQL processes the view. ALGORITHM takes three values:\nMERGE, TEMPTABLE, or UNDEFINED. For more information, see\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/view-algorithms.html, as well\nas\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/derived-table-optimization.html\n.\n\nSome views are updatable. That is, you can use them in statements such\nas UPDATE, DELETE, or INSERT to update the contents of the underlying\ntable. For a view to be updatable, there must be a one-to-one\nrelationship between the rows in the view and the rows in the\nunderlying table. There are also certain other constructs that make a\nview nonupdatable.\n\nA generated column in a view is considered updatable because it is\npossible to assign to it. However, if such a column is updated\nexplicitly, the only permitted value is DEFAULT. For information about\ngenerated columns, see\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/create-table-generated-columns.\nhtml.\n\nThe WITH CHECK OPTION clause can be given for an updatable view to\nprevent inserts or updates to rows except those for which the WHERE\nclause in the select_statement is true.\n\nIn a WITH CHECK OPTION clause for an updatable view, the LOCAL and\nCASCADED keywords determine the scope of check testing when the view is\ndefined in terms of another view. The LOCAL keyword restricts the CHECK\nOPTION only to the view being defined. CASCADED causes the checks for\nunderlying views to be evaluated as well. When neither keyword is\ngiven, the default is CASCADED.\n\nFor more information about updatable views and the WITH CHECK OPTION\nclause, see\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/view-updatability.html, and\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/view-check-option.html.\n\nURL: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/create-view.html\n\n','','https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/create-view.html'),(511,'DROP DATABASE',33,'Syntax:\nDROP {DATABASE | SCHEMA} [IF EXISTS] db_name\n\nDROP DATABASE drops all tables in the database and deletes the\ndatabase.

With the transaction table locking conditions\nsatisfied, the rename operation is done atomically; no other session\ncan access any of the tables while the rename is in progress.\n\nIf any errors occur during a RENAME TABLE, the statement fails and no\nchanges are made.\n\nYou can use RENAME TABLE to move a table from one database to another:\n\nRENAME TABLE current_db.tbl_name TO other_db.tbl_name;\n\nUsing this method to move all tables from one database to a different\none in effect renames the database (an operation for which MySQL has no\nsingle statement), except that the original database continues to\nexist, albeit with no tables.\n\nLike RENAME TABLE, ALTER TABLE ... RENAME can also be used to move a\ntable to a different database. Regardless of the statement used, if the\nrename operation would move the table to a database located on a\ndifferent file system, the success of the outcome is platform specific\nand depends on the underlying operating system calls used to move table\nfiles.\n\nIf a table has triggers, attempts to rename the table into a different\ndatabase fail with a Trigger in wrong schema (ER_TRG_IN_WRONG_SCHEMA)\nerror.\n\nTo rename TEMPORARY tables, RENAME TABLE does not work.

You\nneed only the SELECT privilege for any columns that are only read, such\nas those named in the WHERE clause.\n\nPerformance\n\nWhen you do not need to know the number of deleted rows, the TRUNCATE\nTABLE statement is a faster way to empty a table than a DELETE\nstatement with no WHERE clause. Unlike DELETE, TRUNCATE TABLE cannot be\nused within a transaction or if you have a lock on the table. See [HELP\nTRUNCATE TABLE] and [HELP LOCK TABLES].\n\nThe speed of delete operations may also be affected by factors\ndiscussed in\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/delete-optimization.html.\n\nTo ensure that a given DELETE statement does not take too much time,\nthe MySQL-specific LIMIT row_count clause for DELETE specifies the\nmaximum number of rows to be deleted. If the number of rows to delete\nis larger than the limit, repeat the DELETE statement until the number\nof affected rows is less than the LIMIT value.\n\nSubqueries\n\nYou cannot delete from a table and select from the same table in a\nsubquery.\n\nPartitioned Table Support\n\nDELETE supports explicit partition selection using the PARTITION\noption, which takes a list of the comma-separated names of one or more\npartitions or subpartitions (or both) from which to select rows to be\ndropped. Partitions not included in the list are ignored. Given a\npartitioned table t with a partition named p0, executing the statement\nDELETE FROM t PARTITION (p0) has the same effect on the table as\nexecuting ALTER TABLE t TRUNCATE PARTITION (p0); in both cases, all\nrows in partition p0 are dropped.\n\nPARTITION can be used along with a WHERE condition, in which case the\ncondition is tested only on rows in the listed partitions. For example,\nDELETE FROM t PARTITION (p0) WHERE c < 5 deletes rows only from\npartition p0 for which the condition c < 5 is true; rows in any other\npartitions are not checked and thus not affected by the DELETE.\n\nThe PARTITION option can also be used in multiple-table DELETE\nstatements. You can use up to one such option per table named in the\nFROM option.\n\nFor more information and examples, see\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/partitioning-selection.html.\n\nURL: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/delete.html\n\n','','https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/delete.html'),(526,'DO',34,'Syntax:\nDO expr [, expr] ...\n\nDO executes the expressions but does not return any results.

For example, DO id FROM t1 is invalid because it\nreferences a table.\n\nURL: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/do.html\n\n','','https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/do.html'),(527,'HANDLER',34,'Syntax:\nHANDLER tbl_name OPEN [ [AS] alias]\n\nHANDLER tbl_name READ index_name { = | <= | >= | < | > } (value1,value2,...)\n    [ WHERE where_condition ] [LIMIT ... ]\nHANDLER tbl_name READ index_name { FIRST | NEXT | PREV | LAST }\n    [ WHERE where_condition ] [LIMIT ... ]\nHANDLER tbl_name READ { FIRST | NEXT }\n    [ WHERE where_condition ] [LIMIT ... ]\n\nHANDLER tbl_name CLOSE\n\nThe HANDLER statement provides direct access to table storage engine\ninterfaces.

A session can acquire or\nrelease locks only for itself. One session cannot acquire locks for\nanother session or release locks held by another session.\n\nLocks may be used to emulate transactions or to get more speed when\nupdating tables. This is explained in more detail in\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/lock-tables.html#lock-tables-re\nstrictions.\n\nLOCK TABLES explicitly acquires table locks for the current client\nsession. Table locks can be acquired for base tables or views. You must\nhave the LOCK TABLES privilege, and the SELECT privilege for each\nobject to be locked.\n\nFor view locking, LOCK TABLES adds all base tables used in the view to\nthe set of tables to be locked and locks them automatically. If you\nlock a table explicitly with LOCK TABLES, any tables used in triggers\nare also locked implicitly, as described in\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/lock-tables.html#lock-tables-an\nd-triggers.\n\nUNLOCK TABLES explicitly releases any table locks held by the current\nsession. LOCK TABLES implicitly releases any table locks held by the\ncurrent session before acquiring new locks.\n\nAnother use for UNLOCK TABLES is to release the global read lock\nacquired with the FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK statement, which enables\nyou to lock all tables in all databases. See [HELP FLUSH].

The\naccess mode specifies whether transactions operate in read/write or\nread-only mode.\n\nIn addition, SET TRANSACTION can include an optional GLOBAL or SESSION\nkeyword to indicate the scope of the statement.\n\nURL: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/set-transaction.html\n\n','','https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/set-transaction.html'),(548,'XA',35,'Syntax:\nXA {START|BEGIN} xid [JOIN|RESUME]\n\nXA END xid [SUSPEND [FOR MIGRATE]]\n\nXA PREPARE xid\n\nXA COMMIT xid [ONE PHASE]\n\nXA ROLLBACK xid\n\nXA RECOVER [CONVERT XID]\n\nFor XA START, the JOIN and RESUME clauses are recognized but have no\neffect.\n\nFor XA END the SUSPEND [FOR MIGRATE] clause is recognized but has no\neffect.\n\nEach XA statement begins with the XA keyword, and most of them require\nan xid value. An xid is an XA transaction identifier. It indicates\nwhich transaction the statement applies to. xid values are supplied by\nthe client, or generated by the MySQL server. An xid value has from one\nto three parts:\n\nxid: gtrid [, bqual [, formatID ]]\n\ngtrid is a global transaction identifier, bqual is a branch qualifier,\nand formatID is a number that identifies the format used by the gtrid\nand bqual values. As indicated by the syntax, bqual and formatID are\noptional. The default bqual value is \'\' if not given. The default\nformatID value is 1 if not given.\n\ngtrid and bqual must be string literals, each up to 64 bytes (not\ncharacters) long. gtrid and bqual can be specified in several ways. You\ncan use a quoted string (\'ab\'), hex string (X\'6162\', 0x6162), or bit\nvalue (b\'nnnn\').\n\nformatID is an unsigned integer.\n\nThe gtrid and bqual values are interpreted in bytes by the MySQL\nserver\'s underlying XA support routines. However, while an SQL\nstatement containing an XA statement is being parsed, the server works\nwith some specific character set. To be safe, write gtrid and bqual as\nhex strings.\n\nxid values typically are generated by the Transaction Manager. Values\ngenerated by one TM must be different from values generated by other\nTMs. A given TM must be able to recognize its own xid values in a list\nof values returned by the XA RECOVER statement.\n\nXA START xid starts an XA transaction with the given xid value. Each XA\ntransaction must have a unique xid value, so the value must not\ncurrently be used by another XA transaction. Uniqueness is assessed\nusing the gtrid and bqual values. All following XA statements for the\nXA transaction must be specified using the same xid value as that given\nin the XA START statement. If you use any of those statements but\nspecify an xid value that does not correspond to some existing XA\ntransaction, an error occurs.\n\nOne or more XA transactions can be part of the same global transaction.\nAll XA transactions within a given global transaction must use the same\ngtrid value in the xid value. For this reason, gtrid values must be\nglobally unique so that there is no ambiguity about which global\ntransaction a given XA transaction is part of. The bqual part of the\nxid value must be different for each XA transaction within a global\ntransaction. (The requirement that bqual values be different is a\nlimitation of the current MySQL XA implementation. It is not part of\nthe XA specification.)\n\nThe XA RECOVER statement returns information for those XA transactions\non the MySQL server that are in the PREPARED state. (See\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/xa-states.html.) The output\nincludes a row for each such XA transaction on the server, regardless\nof which client started it.\n\nXA RECOVER output rows look like this (for an example xid value\nconsisting of the parts \'abc\', \'def\', and 7):\n\nmysql> XA RECOVER;\n+----------+--------------+--------------+--------+\n| formatID | gtrid_length | bqual_length | data   |\n+----------+--------------+--------------+--------+\n|        7 |            3 |            3 | abcdef |\n+----------+--------------+--------------+--------+\n\nThe output columns have the following meanings:\n\no formatID is the formatID part of the transaction xid\n\no gtrid_length is the length in bytes of the gtrid part of the xid\n\no bqual_length is the length in bytes of the bqual part of the xid\n\no data is the concatenation of the gtrid and bqual parts of the xid\n\nXID values may contain nonprintable characters. As of MySQL 5.7.5, XA\nRECOVER permits an optional CONVERT XID clause so that clients can\nrequest XID values in hexadecimal.\n\nURL: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/xa-statements.html\n\n','','https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/xa-statements.html'),(549,'PURGE BINARY LOGS',35,'Syntax:\nPURGE { BINARY | MASTER } LOGS {\n    TO \'log_name\'\n  | BEFORE datetime_expr\n}\n\nThe binary log is a set of files that contain information about data\nmodifications made by the MySQL server.

It also updates the contents of the master\ninfo and relay log info repositories (see\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/slave-logs.html). CHANGE MASTER\nTO requires the SUPER privilege.\n\nPrior to MySQL 5.7.4, the slave replication threads must be stopped,\nusing STOP SLAVE if necessary, before issuing this statement. In MySQL\n5.7.4 and later, you can issue CHANGE MASTER TO statements on a running\nslave without doing this, depending on the states of the slave SQL\nthread and slave I/O thread. The rules governing such use are provided\nlater in this section.\n\nWhen using a multithreaded slave (in other words slave_parallel_workers\nis greater than 0), stopping the slave can cause \"gaps\" in the sequence\nof transactions that have been executed from the relay log, regardless\nof whether the slave was stopped intentionally or otherwise. When such\ngaps exist, issuing CHANGE MASTER TO fails. The solution in this\nsituation is to issue START SLAVE UNTIL SQL_AFTER_MTS_GAPS which\nensures that the gaps are closed.\n\nThe optional FOR CHANNEL channel clause enables you to name which\nreplication channel the statement applies to. Providing a FOR CHANNEL\nchannel clause applies the CHANGE MASTER TO statement to a specific\nreplication channel, and is used to add a new channel or modify an\nexisting channel. For example, to add a new channel called channel2:\n\nCHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_HOST=host1, MASTER_PORT=3002 FOR CHANNEL \'channel2\'\n\nIf no clause is named and no extra channels exist, the statement\napplies to the default channel.\n\nWhen using multiple replication channels, if a CHANGE MASTER TO\nstatement does not name a channel using a FOR CHANNEL channel clause,\nan error occurs. See\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/replication-channels.html for\nmore information.\n\nOptions not specified retain their value, except as indicated in the\nfollowing discussion. Thus, in most cases, there is no need to specify\noptions that do not change. For example, if the password to connect to\nyour MySQL master has changed, issue this statement to tell the slave\nabout the new password:\n\nCHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_PASSWORD=\'new3cret\';\n\nMASTER_HOST, MASTER_USER, MASTER_PASSWORD, and MASTER_PORT provide\ninformation to the slave about how to connect to its master:\n\no MASTER_HOST and MASTER_PORT are the host name (or IP address) of the\n  master host and its TCP/IP port.\n\n  *Note*:\n\n  Replication cannot use Unix socket files. You must be able to connect\n  to the master MySQL server using TCP/IP.\n\n  If you specify the MASTER_HOST or MASTER_PORT option, the slave\n  assumes that the master server is different from before (even if the\n  option value is the same as its current value.) In this case, the old\n  values for the master binary log file name and position are\n  considered no longer applicable, so if you do not specify\n  MASTER_LOG_FILE and MASTER_LOG_POS in the statement,\n  MASTER_LOG_FILE=\'\' and MASTER_LOG_POS=4 are silently appended to it.\n\n  Setting MASTER_HOST=\'\' (that is, setting its value explicitly to an\n  empty string) is not the same as not setting MASTER_HOST at all.\n  Beginning with MySQL 5.5, trying to set MASTER_HOST to an empty\n  string fails with an error. Previously, setting MASTER_HOST to an\n  empty string caused START SLAVE subsequently to fail. (Bug #28796)\n\n  Values used for MASTER_HOST and other CHANGE MASTER TO options are\n  checked for linefeed (\\n or 0x0A) characters; the presence of such\n  characters in these values causes the statement to fail with\n  ER_MASTER_INFO. (Bug #11758581, Bug #50801)\n\no MASTER_USER and MASTER_PASSWORD are the user name and password of the\n  account to use for connecting to the master.\n\n  MASTER_USER cannot be made empty; setting MASTER_USER = \'\' or leaving\n  it unset when setting a value for MASTER_PASSWORD causes an error\n  (Bug #13427949).\n\n  The password used for a MySQL Replication slave account in a CHANGE\n  MASTER TO statement is limited to 32 characters in length; prior to\n  MySQL 5.7.5, if the password was longer, the statement succeeded, but\n  any excess characters were silently truncated. In MySQL 5.7.5 and\n  later, trying to use a password of more than 32 characters causes\n  CHANGE MASTER TO to fail. (Bug #11752299, Bug #43439)\n\n  The text of a running CHANGE MASTER TO statement, including values\n  for MASTER_USER and MASTER_PASSWORD, can be seen in the output of a\n  concurrent SHOW PROCESSLIST statement. (The complete text of a START\n  SLAVE statement is also visible to SHOW PROCESSLIST.)\n\nThe MASTER_SSL_xxx options and the MASTER_TLS_VERSION option specify\nhow the slave uses encryption and ciphers to secure the replication\nconnection. These options can be changed even on slaves that are\ncompiled without SSL support. They are saved to the master info\nrepository, but are ignored if the slave does not have SSL support\nenabled. The MASTER_SSL_xxx and MASTER_TLS_VERSION options perform the\nsame functions as the --ssl-xxx and --tls-version client options\ndescribed in\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/connection-options.html#encrypt\ned-connection-options. The correspondence between the two sets of\noptions, and the use of the MASTER_SSL_xxx and MASTER_TLS_VERSION\noptions to set up a secure connection, is explained in\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/replication-solutions-encrypted\n-connections.html.\n\nAs of MySQL 5.7.3, setting MASTER_SSL=1 means that the slave connection\nto the master must use SSL, or the connection attempt fails. Before\n5.7.3, the use of an SSL connection by the slave was not enforced with\nMASTER_SSL=1. This is analogous to the client-side meaning of the --ssl\ncommand-line option; see\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/connection-options.html#encrypt\ned-connection-options.\n\nThe MASTER_HEARTBEAT_PERIOD, MASTER_CONNECT_RETRY, and\nMASTER_RETRY_COUNT options control how the slave recognizes that the\nconnection to the master has been lost and makes attempts to reconnect.\n\no The slave_net_timeout system variable specifies the number of seconds\n  that the slave waits for either more data or a heartbeat signal from\n  the master, before the slave considers the connection broken, aborts\n  the read, and tries to reconnect. The default value is 60 seconds\n  (one minute). Prior to MySQL 5.7.7, the default was 3600 seconds (one\n  hour).\n\no The heartbeat interval, which stops the connection timeout occurring\n  in the absence of data if the connection is still good, is controlled\n  by the MASTER_HEARTBEAT_PERIOD option. A heartbeat signal is sent to\n  the slave after that number of seconds, and the waiting period is\n  reset whenever the master\'s binary log is updated with an event.\n  Heartbeats are therefore sent by the master only if there are no\n  unsent events in the binary log file for a period longer than this.\n  The heartbeat interval interval is a decimal value having the range 0\n  to 4294967 seconds and a resolution in milliseconds; the smallest\n  nonzero value is 0.001. Setting interval to 0 disables heartbeats\n  altogether. The heartbeat interval defaults to half the value of the\n  slave_net_timeout system variable. It is recorded in the master info\n  log and shown in the replication_connection_configuration Performance\n  Schema table. Issuing RESET SLAVE resets the heartbeat interval to\n  the default value.\n\no Prior to MySQL 5.7.4, not including MASTER_HEARTBEAT_PERIOD caused\n  CHANGE MASTER TO to reset the heartbeat interval to the default (half\n  the value of the slave_net_timeout system variable), and\n  Slave_received_heartbeats to 0. The heartbeat interval is now not\n  reset except by RESET SLAVE. (Bug #18185490)\n\no Note that a change to the value or default setting of\n  slave_net_timeout does not automatically change the heartbeat\n  interval, whether that has been set explicitly or is using a\n  previously calculated default. A warning is issued if you set\n  @@GLOBAL.slave_net_timeout to a value less than that of the current\n  heartbeat interval. If slave_net_timeout is changed, you must also\n  issue CHANGE MASTER TO to adjust the heartbeat interval to an\n  appropriate value so that the heartbeat signal occurs before the\n  connection timeout. If you do not do this, the heartbeat signal has\n  no effect, and if no data is received from the master, the slave can\n  make repeated reconnection attempts, creating zombie dump threads.\n\no If the slave does need to reconnect, the first retry occurs\n  immediately after the timeout. MASTER_CONNECT_RETRY specifies the\n  interval between reconnection attempts, and MASTER_RETRY_COUNT limits\n  the number of reconnection attempts. If both the default settings are\n  used, the slave waits 60 seconds between reconnection attempts\n  (MASTER_CONNECT_RETRY=60), and keeps attempting to reconnect at this\n  rate for 60 days (MASTER_RETRY_COUNT=86400). These values are\n  recorded in the master info log and shown in the\n  replication_connection_configuration Performance Schema table.\n  MASTER_RETRY_COUNT supersedes the --master-retry-count server startup\n  option.\n\nMASTER_DELAY specifies how many seconds behind the master the slave\nmust lag. An event received from the master is not executed until at\nleast interval seconds later than its execution on the master. The\ndefault is 0. An error occurs if interval is not a nonnegative integer\nin the range from 0 to 231−1. For more information, see\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/replication-delayed.html.\n\nFrom MySQL 5.7, a CHANGE MASTER TO statement employing the MASTER_DELAY\noption can be executed on a running slave when the slave SQL thread is\nstopped.\n\nMASTER_BIND is for use on replication slaves having multiple network\ninterfaces, and determines which of the slave\'s network interfaces is\nchosen for connecting to the master.\n\nThe address configured with this option, if any, can be seen in the\nMaster_Bind column of the output from SHOW SLAVE STATUS. If you are\nusing slave status log tables (server started with\nmaster_info_repository=TABLE), the value can also be seen as the\nMaster_bind column of the mysql.slave_master_info table.\n\nThe ability to bind a replication slave to a specific network interface\nis also supported by NDB Cluster.\n\nMASTER_LOG_FILE and MASTER_LOG_POS are the coordinates at which the\nslave I/O thread should begin reading from the master the next time the\nthread starts. RELAY_LOG_FILE and RELAY_LOG_POS are the coordinates at\nwhich the slave SQL thread should begin reading from the relay log the\nnext time the thread starts. If you specify either of MASTER_LOG_FILE\nor MASTER_LOG_POS, you cannot specify RELAY_LOG_FILE or RELAY_LOG_POS.\nIf you specify either of MASTER_LOG_FILE or MASTER_LOG_POS, you also\ncannot specify MASTER_AUTO_POSITION = 1 (described later in this\nsection). If neither of MASTER_LOG_FILE or MASTER_LOG_POS is specified,\nthe slave uses the last coordinates of the slave SQL thread before\nCHANGE MASTER TO was issued. This ensures that there is no\ndiscontinuity in replication, even if the slave SQL thread was late\ncompared to the slave I/O thread, when you merely want to change, say,\nthe password to use.\n\nFrom MySQL 5.7, a CHANGE MASTER TO statement employing RELAY_LOG_FILE,\nRELAY_LOG_POS, or both options can be executed on a running slave when\nthe slave SQL thread is stopped. Prior to MySQL 5.7.4, CHANGE MASTER TO\ndeletes all relay log files and starts a new one, unless you specify\nRELAY_LOG_FILE or RELAY_LOG_POS. In that case, relay log files are\nkept; the relay_log_purge global variable is set silently to 0. In\nMySQL 5.7.4 and later, relay logs are preserved if at least one of the\nslave SQL thread and the slave I/O thread is running. If both threads\nare stopped, all relay log files are deleted unless at least one of\nRELAY_LOG_FILE or RELAY_LOG_POS is specified. Note that the Group\nReplication applier channel (group_replication_applier) has no I/O\nthread, only a SQL thread. For this channel, the relay logs are not\npreserved when the SQL thread is stopped.\n\nRELAY_LOG_FILE can use either an absolute or relative path, and uses\nthe same base name as MASTER_LOG_FILE. (Bug #12190)\n\nWhen MASTER_AUTO_POSITION = 1 is used with CHANGE MASTER TO, the slave\nattempts to connect to the master using the GTID-based replication\nprotocol. From MySQL 5.7, this option can be employed by CHANGE MASTER\nTO only if both the slave SQL and slave I/O threads are stopped. Both\nthe slave and the master must have GTIDs enabled (GTID_MODE=ON,\nON_PERMISSIVE, or OFF_PERMISSIVE on the slave, and GTID_MODE=ON on the\nmaster). Auto-positioning is used for the connection, so the\ncoordinates represented by MASTER_LOG_FILE and MASTER_LOG_POS are not\nused, and the use of either or both of these options together with\nMASTER_AUTO_POSITION = 1 causes an error. If multi-source replication\nis enabled on the slave, you need to set the MASTER_AUTO_POSITION = 1\noption for each applicable replication channel.\n\nWith MASTER_AUTO_POSITION = 1 set, in the initial connection handshake,\nthe slave sends a GTID set containing the transactions that it has\nalready received, committed, or both. The master responds by sending\nall transactions recorded in its binary log whose GTID is not included\nin the GTID set sent by the slave. This exchange ensures that the\nmaster only sends the transactions with a GTID that the slave has not\nalready recorded or committed. If the slave receives transactions from\nmore than one master, as in the case of a diamond topology, the\nauto-skip function ensures that the transactions are not applied twice.\nFor details of how the GTID set sent by the slave is computed, see\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/replication-gtids-auto-position\ning.html.\n\nIf any of the transactions that should be sent by the master have been\npurged from the master\'s binary log, or added to the set of GTIDs in\nthe gtid_purged system variable by another method, the master sends the\nerror ER_MASTER_HAS_PURGED_REQUIRED_GTIDS to the slave, and replication\ndoes not start. Also, if during the exchange of transactions it is\nfound that the slave has recorded or committed transactions with the\nmaster\'s UUID in the GTID, but the master itself has not committed\nthem, the master sends the error ER_SLAVE_HAS_MORE_GTIDS_THAN_MASTER to\nthe slave and replication does not start. For information on how to\nhandle these situations, see\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/replication-gtids-auto-position\ning.html.\n\nYou can see whether replication is running with auto-positioning\nenabled by checking the Performance Schema\nreplication_connection_status table or the output of SHOW SLAVE STATUS.\nDisabling the MASTER_AUTO_POSITION option again makes the slave revert\nto file-based replication, in which case you must also specify one or\nboth of the MASTER_LOG_FILE or MASTER_LOG_POS options.\n\nIGNORE_SERVER_IDS takes a comma-separated list of 0 or more server IDs.\nEvents originating from the corresponding servers are ignored, with the\nexception of log rotation and deletion events, which are still recorded\nin the relay log.\n\nIn circular replication, the originating server normally acts as the\nterminator of its own events, so that they are not applied more than\nonce. Thus, this option is useful in circular replication when one of\nthe servers in the circle is removed. Suppose that you have a circular\nreplication setup with 4 servers, having server IDs 1, 2, 3, and 4, and\nserver 3 fails. When bridging the gap by starting replication from\nserver 2 to server 4, you can include IGNORE_SERVER_IDS = (3) in the\nCHANGE MASTER TO statement that you issue on server 4 to tell it to use\nserver 2 as its master instead of server 3. Doing so causes it to\nignore and not to propagate any statements that originated with the\nserver that is no longer in use.\n\nIf a CHANGE MASTER TO statement is issued without any IGNORE_SERVER_IDS\noption, any existing list is preserved. To clear the list of ignored\nservers, it is necessary to use the option with an empty list:\n\nCHANGE MASTER TO IGNORE_SERVER_IDS = ();\n\nPrior to MySQL 5.7.5, RESET SLAVE ALL has no effect on the server ID\nlist. In MySQL 5.7.5 and later, RESET SLAVE ALL clears\nIGNORE_SERVER_IDS. (Bug #18816897)\n\nIf IGNORE_SERVER_IDS contains the server\'s own ID and the server was\nstarted with the --replicate-same-server-id option enabled, an error\nresults.\n\nThe master info repository and the output of SHOW SLAVE STATUS provide\nthe list of servers that are currently ignored. For more information,\nsee https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/slave-logs-status.html, and\n[HELP SHOW SLAVE STATUS].\n\nInvoking CHANGE MASTER TO causes the previous values for MASTER_HOST,\nMASTER_PORT, MASTER_LOG_FILE, and MASTER_LOG_POS to be written to the\nerror log, along with other information about the slave\'s state prior\nto execution.\n\nCHANGE MASTER TO causes an implicit commit of an ongoing transaction.\nSee https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/implicit-commit.html.\n\nIn MySQL 5.7.4 and later, the strict requirement to execute STOP SLAVE\nprior to issuing any CHANGE MASTER TO statement (and START SLAVE\nafterward) is removed. Instead of depending on whether the slave is\nstopped, the behavior of CHANGE MASTER TO depends (in MySQL 5.7.4 and\nlater) on the states of the slave SQL thread and slave I/O threads;\nwhich of these threads is stopped or running now determines the options\nthat can or cannot be used with a CHANGE MASTER TO statement at a given\npoint in time. The rules for making this determination are listed here:\n\no If the SQL thread is stopped, you can execute CHANGE MASTER TO using\n  any combination that is otherwise allowed of RELAY_LOG_FILE,\n  RELAY_LOG_POS, and MASTER_DELAY options, even if the slave I/O thread\n  is running. No other options may be used with this statement when the\n  I/O thread is running.\n\no If the I/O thread is stopped, you can execute CHANGE MASTER TO using\n  any of the options for this statement (in any allowed combination)\n  except RELAY_LOG_FILE, RELAY_LOG_POS, MASTER_DELAY, or\n  MASTER_AUTO_POSITION = 1 even when the SQL thread is running.\n\no Both the SQL thread and the I/O thread must be stopped before issuing\n  a CHANGE MASTER TO statement that employs MASTER_AUTO_POSITION = 1.\n\nYou can check the current state of the slave SQL and I/O threads using\nSHOW SLAVE STATUS. Note that the Group Replication applier channel\n(group_replication_applier) has no I/O thread, only a SQL thread.\n\nFor more information, see\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/replication-solutions-switch.ht\nml.\n\nIf you are using statement-based replication and temporary tables, it\nis possible for a CHANGE MASTER TO statement following a STOP SLAVE\nstatement to leave behind temporary tables on the slave. From MySQL\n5.7, a warning (ER_WARN_OPEN_TEMP_TABLES_MUST_BE_ZERO) is issued\nwhenever this occurs. You can avoid this in such cases by making sure\nthat the value of the Slave_open_temp_tables system status variable is\nequal to 0 prior to executing such a CHANGE MASTER TO statement.\n\nCHANGE MASTER TO is useful for setting up a slave when you have the\nsnapshot of the master and have recorded the master binary log\ncoordinates corresponding to the time of the snapshot. After loading\nthe snapshot into the slave to synchronize it with the master, you can\nrun CHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_LOG_FILE=\'log_name\', MASTER_LOG_POS=log_pos\non the slave to specify the coordinates at which the slave should begin\nreading the master binary log.\n\nThe following example changes the master server the slave uses and\nestablishes the master binary log coordinates from which the slave\nbegins reading. This is used when you want to set up the slave to\nreplicate the master:\n\nCHANGE MASTER TO\n  MASTER_HOST=\'master2.example.com\',\n  MASTER_USER=\'replication\',\n  MASTER_PASSWORD=\'password\',\n  MASTER_PORT=3306,\n  MASTER_LOG_FILE=\'master2-bin.001\',\n  MASTER_LOG_POS=4,\n  MASTER_CONNECT_RETRY=10;\n\nThe next example shows an operation that is less frequently employed.\nIt is used when the slave has relay log files that you want it to\nexecute again for some reason. To do this, the master need not be\nreachable. You need only use CHANGE MASTER TO and start the SQL thread\n(START SLAVE SQL_THREAD):\n\nCHANGE MASTER TO\n  RELAY_LOG_FILE=\'slave-relay-bin.006\',\n  RELAY_LOG_POS=4025;\n\nURL: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/change-master-to.html\n\n','','https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/change-master-to.html'),(554,'CHANGE REPLICATION FILTER',35,'Syntax:\nCHANGE REPLICATION FILTER filter[, filter][, ...]\n\nfilter:\n    REPLICATE_DO_DB = (db_list)\n  | REPLICATE_IGNORE_DB = (db_list)\n  | REPLICATE_DO_TABLE = (tbl_list)\n  | REPLICATE_IGNORE_TABLE = (tbl_list)\n  | REPLICATE_WILD_DO_TABLE = (wild_tbl_list)\n  | REPLICATE_WILD_IGNORE_TABLE = (wild_tbl_list)\n  | REPLICATE_REWRITE_DB = (db_pair_list)\n\ndb_list:\n    db_name[, db_name][, ...]\n\ntbl_list:\n    db_name.table_name[, db_table_name][, ...]\nwild_tbl_list:\n    \'db_pattern.table_pattern\'[, \'db_pattern.table_pattern\'][, ...]\n\ndb_pair_list:\n    (db_pair)[, (db_pair)][, ...]\n\ndb_pair:\n    from_db, to_db\n\nCHANGE REPLICATION FILTER sets one or more replication filtering rules\non the slave in the same way as starting the slave mysqld with\nreplication filtering options such as --replicate-do-db or\n--replicate-wild-ignore-table. Unlike the case with the server options,\nthis statement does not require restarting the server to take effect,\nonly that the slave SQL thread be stopped using STOP SLAVE SQL_THREAD\nfirst (and restarted with START SLAVE SQL_THREAD afterwards). CHANGE\nREPLICATION FILTER requires the SUPER privilege.\n\nReplication filters cannot be set on a MySQL server instance that is\nconfigured for Group Replication, because filtering transactions on\nsome servers would make the group unable to reach agreement on a\nconsistent state.\n\nThe following list shows the CHANGE REPLICATION FILTER options and how\nthey relate to --replicate-* server options:\n\no REPLICATE_DO_DB: Include updates based on database name. Equivalent\n  to --replicate-do-db.\n\no REPLICATE_IGNORE_DB: Exclude updates based on database name.\n  Equivalent to --replicate-ignore-db.\n\no REPLICATE_DO_TABLE: Include updates based on table name. Equivalent\n  to --replicate-do-table.\n\no REPLICATE_IGNORE_TABLE: Exclude updates based on table name.\n  Equivalent to --replicate-ignore-table.\n\no REPLICATE_WILD_DO_TABLE: Include updates based on wildcard pattern\n  matching table name. Equivalent to --replicate-wild-do-table.\n\no REPLICATE_WILD_IGNORE_TABLE: Exclude updates based on wildcard\n  pattern matching table name. Equivalent to\n  --replicate-wild-ignore-table.\n\no REPLICATE_REWRITE_DB: Perform updates on slave after substituting new\n  name on slave for specified database on master. Equivalent to\n  --replicate-rewrite-db.\n\nThe precise effects of REPLICATE_DO_DB and REPLICATE_IGNORE_DB filters\nare dependent on whether statement-based or row-based replication is in\neffect. See\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/replication-rules.html, for\nmore information.\n\nMultiple replication filtering rules can be created in a single CHANGE\nREPLICATION FILTER statement by separating the rules with commas, as\nshown here:\n\nCHANGE REPLICATION FILTER\n    REPLICATE_DO_DB = (d1), REPLICATE_IGNORE_DB = (d2);\n\nIssuing the statement just shown is equivalent to starting the slave\nmysqld with the options --replicate-do-db=d1 --replicate-ignore-db=d2.\n\nIf the same filtering rule is specified multiple times, only the last\nsuch rule is actually used. For example, the two statements shown here\nhave exactly the same effect, because the first REPLICATE_DO_DB rule in\nthe first statement is ignored:\n\nCHANGE REPLICATION FILTER\n    REPLICATE_DO_DB = (db1, db2), REPLICATE_DO_DB = (db3, db4);\n\nCHANGE REPLICATION FILTER\n    REPLICATE_DO_DB = (db3,db4);\n\n*Caution*:\n\nThis behavior differs from that of the --replicate-* filter options\nwhere specifying the same option multiple times causes the creation of\nmultiple filter rules.\n\nNames of tables and database not containing any special characters need\nnot be quoted. Values used with REPLICATION_WILD_TABLE and\nREPLICATION_WILD_IGNORE_TABLE are string expressions, possibly\ncontaining (special) wildcard characters, and so must be quoted. This\nis shown in the following example statements:\n\nCHANGE REPLICATION FILTER\n    REPLICATE_WILD_DO_TABLE = (\'db1.old%\');\n\nCHANGE REPLICATION FILTER\n    REPLICATE_WILD_IGNORE_TABLE = (\'db1.new%\', \'db2.new%\');\n\nValues used with REPLICATE_REWRITE_DB represent pairs of database\nnames; each such value must be enclosed in parentheses. The following\nstatement rewrites statements occurring on database db1 on the master\nto database db2 on the slave:\n\nCHANGE REPLICATION FILTER REPLICATE_REWRITE_DB = ((db1, db2));\n\nThe statement just shown contains two sets of parentheses, one\nenclosing the pair of database names, and the other enclosing the\nentire list. This is perhaps more easily seen in the following example,\nwhich creates two rewrite-db rules, one rewriting database dbA to dbB,\nand one rewriting database dbC to dbD:\n\nCHANGE REPLICATION FILTER\n  REPLICATE_REWRITE_DB = ((dbA, dbB), (dbC, dbD));\n\nThis statement leaves any existing replication filtering rules\nunchanged; to unset all filters of a given type, set the filter\'s value\nto an explicitly empty list, as shown in this example, which removes\nall existing REPLICATE_DO_DB and REPLICATE_IGNORE_DB rules:\n\nCHANGE REPLICATION FILTER\n    REPLICATE_DO_DB = (), REPLICATE_IGNORE_DB = ();\n\nSetting a filter to empty in this way removes all existing rules, does\nnot create any new ones, and does not restore any rules set at mysqld\nstartup using --replicate-* options on the command line or in the\nconfiguration file.\n\nValues employed with REPLICATE_WILD_DO_TABLE and\nREPLICATE_WILD_IGNORE_TABLE must be in the format db_name.tbl_name.\nPrior to MySQL 5.7.5, this was not strictly enforced, although using\nnonconforming values with these options could lead to erroneous results\n(Bug #18095449).\n\nFor more information, see\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/replication-rules.html.\n\nURL: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/change-replication-filter.html\n\n','','https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/change-replication-filter.html'),(555,'RESET SLAVE',35,'Syntax:\nRESET SLAVE [ALL] [channel_option]\n\nchannel_option:\n    FOR CHANNEL channel\n\nRESET SLAVE makes the slave forget its replication position in the\nmaster\'s binary log. This statement is meant to be used for a clean\nstart: It clears the master info and relay log info repositories,\ndeletes all the relay log files, and starts a new relay log file. It\nalso resets to 0 the replication delay specified with the MASTER_DELAY\noption to CHANGE MASTER TO.\n\n*Note*:\n\nAll relay log files are deleted, even if they have not been completely\nexecuted by the slave SQL thread. (This is a condition likely to exist\non a replication slave if you have issued a STOP SLAVE statement or if\nthe slave is highly loaded.)\n\nFor a server where GTIDs are in use (gtid_mode is ON), issuing RESET\nSLAVE has no effect on the GTID execution history. The statement does\nnot change the values of gtid_executed or gtid_purged, or the\nmysql.gtid_executed table. If you need to reset the GTID execution\nhistory, use RESET MASTER, even if the GTID-enabled server is a\nreplication slave where binary logging is disabled.\n\nRESET SLAVE requires the RELOAD privilege.\n\nTo use RESET SLAVE, the slave replication threads must be stopped, so\non a running slave use STOP SLAVE before issuing RESET SLAVE. To use\nRESET SLAVE on a Group Replication group member, the member status must\nbe OFFLINE, meaning that the plugin is loaded but the member does not\ncurrently belong to any group. A group member can be taken offline by\nusing a STOP GROUP REPLICATION statement.\n\nThe optional FOR CHANNEL channel clause enables you to name which\nreplication channel the statement applies to. Providing a FOR CHANNEL\nchannel clause applies the RESET SLAVE statement to a specific\nreplication channel. Combining a FOR CHANNEL channel clause with the\nALL option deletes the specified channel. If no channel is named and no\nextra channels exist, the statement applies to the default channel.\nIssuing a RESET SLAVE ALL statement without a FOR CHANNEL channel\nclause when multiple replication channels exist deletes all replication\nchannels and recreates only the default channel. See\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/replication-channels.html for\nmore information.\n\nRESET SLAVE does not change any replication connection parameters such\nas master host, master port, master user, or master password.\n\no From MySQL 5.7.24, when master_info_repository=TABLE is set on the\n  server, replication connection parameters are preserved in the\n  crash-safe InnoDB table mysql.slave_master_info as part of the RESET\n  SLAVE operation. They are also retained in memory. In the event of a\n  server crash or deliberate restart after issuing RESET SLAVE but\n  before issuing START SLAVE, the replication connection parameters are\n  retrieved from the table and reused for the new connection.\n\no When master_info_repository=FILE is set on the server (which is the\n  default in MySQL 5.7), replication connection parameters are only\n  retained in memory. If the slave mysqld is restarted immediately\n  after issuing RESET SLAVE due to a server crash or deliberate\n  restart, the connection parameters are lost. In that case, you must\n  issue a CHANGE MASTER TO statement after the server start to\n  respecify the connection parameters before issuing START SLAVE.\n\nIf you want to reset the connection parameters intentionally, you need\nto use RESET SLAVE ALL, which clears the connection parameters. In that\ncase, you must issue a CHANGE MASTER TO statement after the server\nstart to specify the new connection parameters.\n\nRESET SLAVE causes an implicit commit of an ongoing transaction. See\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/implicit-commit.html.\n\nIf the slave SQL thread was in the middle of replicating temporary\ntables when it was stopped, and RESET SLAVE is issued, these replicated\ntemporary tables are deleted on the slave.\n\nPrior to MySQL 5.7.5, RESET SLAVE also had the effect of resetting both\nthe heartbeat period (Slave_heartbeat_period) and\nSSL_VERIFY_SERVER_CERT. This issue is fixed in MySQL 5.7.5 and later.\n(Bug #18777899, Bug #18778485)\n\nPrior to MySQL 5.7.5, RESET SLAVE ALL did not clear the\nIGNORE_SERVER_IDS list set by CHANGE MASTER TO. In MySQL 5.7.5 and\nlater, the statement clears the list. (Bug #18816897)\n\n*Note*:\n\nWhen used on an NDB Cluster replication slave SQL node, RESET SLAVE\nclears the mysql.ndb_apply_status table. You should keep in mind when\nusing this statement that ndb_apply_status uses the NDB storage engine\nand so is shared by all SQL nodes attached to the slave cluster.\n\nYou can override this behavior by issuing SET GLOBAL\n@@ndb_clear_apply_status=OFF prior to executing RESET SLAVE, which\nkeeps the slave from purging the ndb_apply_status table in such cases.\n\nURL: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/reset-slave.html\n\n','','https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/reset-slave.html'),(556,'SET GLOBAL SQL_SLAVE_SKIP_COUNTER',35,'Syntax:\nSET GLOBAL sql_slave_skip_counter = N\n\nThis statement skips the next N events from the master.

The I/O thread reads events from the master server and stores\nthem in the relay log. The SQL thread reads events from the relay log\nand executes them. START SLAVE requires the REPLICATION_SLAVE_ADMIN\n(https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/privileges-provided.html#priv_\nreplication-slave-admin) or SUPER privilege.\n\nIf START SLAVE succeeds in starting the slave threads, it returns\nwithout any error. However, even in that case, it might be that the\nslave threads start and then later stop (for example, because they do\nnot manage to connect to the master or read its binary log, or some\nother problem). START SLAVE does not warn you about this. You must\ncheck the slave\'s error log for error messages generated by the slave\nthreads, or check that they are running satisfactorily with SHOW SLAVE\nSTATUS.\n\nIn MySQL 5.7, START SLAVE causes an implicit commit of an ongoing\ntransaction. See\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/implicit-commit.html.\n\ngtid_next must be set to AUTOMATIC before issuing this statement.\n\nThe optional FOR CHANNEL channel clause enables you to name which\nreplication channel the statement applies to. Providing a FOR CHANNEL\nchannel clause applies the START SLAVE statement to a specific\nreplication channel. If no clause is named and no extra channels exist,\nthe statement applies to the default channel. If a START SLAVE\nstatement does not have a channel defined when using multiple channels,\nthis statement starts the specified threads for all channels. This\nstatement is disallowed for the group_replication_recovery channel. See\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/replication-channels.html for\nmore information.\n\nYou can add IO_THREAD and SQL_THREAD options to the statement to name\nwhich of the threads to start. Note that the Group Replication applier\nchannel (group_replication_applier) has no I/O thread, only a SQL\nthread. Specifying the IO_THREAD or SQL_THREAD options when you start\nthis channel has no benefit.\n\nMySQL supports pluggable user-password authentication with START SLAVE\nwith the USER, PASSWORD, DEFAULT_AUTH and PLUGIN_DIR options, as\ndescribed in the following list:\n\no USER: User name. Cannot be set to an empty or null string, or left\n  unset if PASSWORD is used.\n\no PASSWORD: Password.\n\no DEFAULT_AUTH: Name of plugin; default is MySQL native authentication.\n\no PLUGIN_DIR: Location of plugin.\n\nYou cannot use the SQL_THREAD option when specifying any of USER,\nPASSWORD, DEFAULT_AUTH, or PLUGIN_DIR, unless the IO_THREAD option is\nalso provided.\n\nSee\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/pluggable-authentication.html,\nfor more information.\n\nIf an insecure connection is used with any these options, the server\nissues the warning Sending passwords in plain text without SSL/TLS is\nextremely insecure.\n\nSTART SLAVE ... UNTIL supports two additional options for use with\nglobal transaction identifiers (GTIDs) (see\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/replication-gtids.html). Each\nof these takes a set of one or more global transaction identifiers\ngtid_set as an argument (see\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/replication-gtids-concepts.html\n#replication-gtids-concepts-gtid-sets, for more information).\n\nWhen no thread_type is specified, START SLAVE UNTIL SQL_BEFORE_GTIDS\ncauses the slave SQL thread to process transactions until it has\nreached the first transaction whose GTID is listed in the gtid_set.\nSTART SLAVE UNTIL SQL_AFTER_GTIDS causes the slave threads to process\nall transactions until the last transaction in the gtid_set has been\nprocessed by both threads. In other words, START SLAVE UNTIL\nSQL_BEFORE_GTIDS causes the slave SQL thread to process all\ntransactions occurring before the first GTID in the gtid_set is\nreached, and START SLAVE UNTIL SQL_AFTER_GTIDS causes the slave threads\nto handle all transactions, including those whose GTIDs are found in\ngtid_set, until each has encountered a transaction whose GTID is not\npart of the set. SQL_BEFORE_GTIDS and SQL_AFTER_GTIDS each support the\nSQL_THREAD and IO_THREAD options, although using IO_THREAD with them\ncurrently has no effect.\n\nFor example, START SLAVE SQL_THREAD UNTIL SQL_BEFORE_GTIDS =\n3E11FA47-71CA-11E1-9E33-C80AA9429562:11-56 causes the slave SQL thread\nto process all transactions originating from the master whose\nserver_uuid is 3E11FA47-71CA-11E1-9E33-C80AA9429562 until it encounters\nthe transaction having sequence number 11; it then stops without\nprocessing this transaction. In other words, all transactions up to and\nincluding the transaction with sequence number 10 are processed.\nExecuting START SLAVE SQL_THREAD UNTIL SQL_AFTER_GTIDS =\n3E11FA47-71CA-11E1-9E33-C80AA9429562:11-56, on the other hand, would\ncause the slave SQL thread to obtain all transactions just mentioned\nfrom the master, including all of the transactions having the sequence\nnumbers 11 through 56, and then to stop without processing any\nadditional transactions; that is, the transaction having sequence\nnumber 56 would be the last transaction fetched by the slave SQL\nthread.\n\nPrior to MySQL 5.7.3, SQL_AFTER_GTIDS did not stop the slave once the\nindicated transaction was completed, but waited until another GTID\nevent was received (Bug #14767986).\n\nWhen using a multithreaded slave, there is a chance of gaps in the\nsequence of transactions that have been executed from the relay log in\nthe following cases:\n\no killing the coordinator thread\n\no after an error occurs in the worker threads\n\no mysqld shuts down unexpectedly\n\nUse the START SLAVE UNTIL SQL_AFTER_MTS_GAPS statement to cause a\nmultithreaded slave\'s worker threads to only run until no more gaps are\nfound in the relay log, and then to stop. This statement can take an\nSQL_THREAD option, but the effects of the statement remain unchanged.\nIt has no effect on the slave I/O thread (and cannot be used with the\nIO_THREAD option).\n\nIssuing START SLAVE on a multithreaded slave with gaps in the sequence\nof transactions executed from the relay log generates a warning. In\nsuch a situation, the solution is to use START SLAVE UNTIL\nSQL_AFTER_MTS_GAPS, then issue RESET SLAVE to remove any remaining\nrelay logs. See\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/replication-features-transactio\nn-inconsistencies.html for more information.\n\nTo change a failed multithreaded slave to single-threaded mode, you can\nissue the following series of statements, in the order shown:\n\nSTART SLAVE UNTIL SQL_AFTER_MTS_GAPS;\n\nSET @@GLOBAL.slave_parallel_workers = 0;\n\nSTART SLAVE SQL_THREAD;\n\n*Note*:\n\nIt is possible to view the entire text of a running START SLAVE ...\nstatement, including any USER or PASSWORD values used, in the output of\nSHOW PROCESSLIST.

STOP SLAVE requires the\nREPLICATION_SLAVE_ADMIN\n(https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/privileges-provided.html#priv_\nreplication-slave-admin) or SUPER privilege. Recommended best practice\nis to execute STOP SLAVE on the slave before stopping the slave server\n(see https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/server-shutdown.html, for\nmore information).\n\nWhen using the row-based logging format: You should execute STOP SLAVE\nor STOP SLAVE SQL_THREAD on the slave prior to shutting down the slave\nserver if you are replicating any tables that use a nontransactional\nstorage engine (see the Note later in this section).\n\nLike START SLAVE, this statement may be used with the IO_THREAD and\nSQL_THREAD options to name the thread or threads to be stopped. Note\nthat the Group Replication applier channel (group_replication_applier)\nhas no I/O thread, only a SQL thread. Using the SQL_THREAD option\ntherefore stops this channel completely.\n\nSTOP SLAVE causes an implicit commit of an ongoing transaction. See\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/implicit-commit.html.\n\nFrom MySQL 5.7, gtid_next must be set to AUTOMATIC before issuing this\nstatement (Bug #16062608).\n\nFrom MySQL 5.7, you can control how long STOP SLAVE waits before timing\nout by setting the rpl_stop_slave_timeout system variable. This can be\nused to avoid deadlocks between STOP SLAVE and other slave SQL\nstatements using different client connections to the slave. When the\ntimeout value is reached, the issuing client returns an error message\nand stops waiting, but the STOP SLAVE instruction remains in effect.\nOnce the slave threads are no longer busy, the STOP SLAVE statement is\nexecuted and the slave stops. (Bug #16856735)\n\nSome CHANGE MASTER TO statements are allowed while the slave is\nrunning, depending on the states of the slave SQL and I/O threads.\nHowever, using STOP SLAVE prior to executing CHANGE MASTER TO in such\ncases is still supported. See [HELP CHANGE MASTER TO], and\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/replication-solutions-switch.ht\nml, for more information.\n\nThe optional FOR CHANNEL channel clause enables you to name which\nreplication channel the statement applies to. Providing a FOR CHANNEL\nchannel clause applies the STOP SLAVE statement to a specific\nreplication channel. If no channel is named and no extra channels\nexist, the statement applies to the default channel. If a STOP SLAVE\nstatement does not name a channel when using multiple channels, this\nstatement stops the specified threads for all channels. This statement\ncannot be used with the group_replication_recovery channel. See\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/replication-channels.html for\nmore information.\n\nWhen using statement-based replication: changing the master while it\nhas open temporary tables is potentially unsafe. This is one of the\nreasons why statement-based replication of temporary tables is not\nrecommended. You can find out whether there are any temporary tables on\nthe slave by checking the value of Slave_open_temp_tables; when using\nstatement-based replication, this value should be 0 before executing\nCHANGE MASTER TO. If there are any temporary tables open on the slave,\nissuing a CHANGE MASTER TO statement after issuing a STOP SLAVE causes\nan ER_WARN_OPEN_TEMP_TABLES_MUST_BE_ZERO warning.\n\nWhen using a multithreaded slave (slave_parallel_workers is a nonzero\nvalue), any gaps in the sequence of transactions executed from the\nrelay log are closed as part of stopping the worker threads.

The keyword STACKED means to retrieve information\nfrom the second diagnostics area, which is available only if the\ncurrent context is a condition handler. If neither keyword is given,\nthe default is to use the current diagnostics area.\n\nThe GET DIAGNOSTICS statement is typically used in a handler within a\nstored program. It is a MySQL extension that GET [CURRENT] DIAGNOSTICS\nis permitted outside handler context to check the execution of any SQL\nstatement. For example, if you invoke the mysql client program, you can\nenter these statements at the prompt:\n\nmysql> DROP TABLE test.no_such_table;\nERROR 1051 (42S02): Unknown table \'test.no_such_table\'\nmysql> GET DIAGNOSTICS CONDITION 1\n         @p1 = RETURNED_SQLSTATE, @p2 = MESSAGE_TEXT;\nmysql> SELECT @p1, @p2;\n+-------+------------------------------------+\n| @p1   | @p2                                |\n+-------+------------------------------------+\n| 42S02 | Unknown table \'test.no_such_table\' |\n+-------+------------------------------------+\n\nThis extension applies only to the current diagnostics area. It does\nnot apply to the second diagnostics area because GET STACKED\nDIAGNOSTICS is permitted only if the current context is a condition\nhandler. If that is not the case, a GET STACKED DIAGNOSTICS when\nhandler not active error occurs.\n\nFor a description of the diagnostics area, see\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/diagnostics-area.html. Briefly,\nit contains two kinds of information:\n\no Statement information, such as the number of conditions that occurred\n  or the affected-rows count.\n\no Condition information, such as the error code and message. If a\n  statement raises multiple conditions, this part of the diagnostics\n  area has a condition area for each one. If a statement raises no\n  conditions, this part of the diagnostics area is empty.\n\nFor a statement that produces three conditions, the diagnostics area\ncontains statement and condition information like this:\n\nStatement information:\n  row count\n  ... other statement information items ...\nCondition area list:\n  Condition area 1:\n    error code for condition 1\n    error message for condition 1\n    ... other condition information items ...\n  Condition area 2:\n    error code for condition 2:\n    error message for condition 2\n    ... other condition information items ...\n  Condition area 3:\n    error code for condition 3\n    error message for condition 3\n    ... other condition information items ...\n\nGET DIAGNOSTICS can obtain either statement or condition information,\nbut not both in the same statement:\n\no To obtain statement information, retrieve the desired statement items\n  into target variables. This instance of GET DIAGNOSTICS assigns the\n  number of available conditions and the rows-affected count to the\n  user variables @p1 and @p2:\n\nGET DIAGNOSTICS @p1 = NUMBER, @p2 = ROW_COUNT;\n\no To obtain condition information, specify the condition number and\n  retrieve the desired condition items into target variables. This\n  instance of GET DIAGNOSTICS assigns the SQLSTATE value and error\n  message to the user variables @p3 and @p4:\n\nGET DIAGNOSTICS CONDITION 1\n  @p3 = RETURNED_SQLSTATE, @p4 = MESSAGE_TEXT;\n\nThe retrieval list specifies one or more target = item_name\nassignments, separated by commas. Each assignment names a target\nvariable and either a statement_information_item_name or\ncondition_information_item_name designator, depending on whether the\nstatement retrieves statement or condition information.\n\nValid target designators for storing item information can be stored\nprocedure or function parameters, stored program local variables\ndeclared with DECLARE, or user-defined variables.\n\nValid condition_number designators can be stored procedure or function\nparameters, stored program local variables declared with DECLARE,\nuser-defined variables, system variables, or literals. A character\nliteral may include a _charset introducer. A warning occurs if the\ncondition number is not in the range from 1 to the number of condition\nareas that have information. In this case, the warning is added to the\ndiagnostics area without clearing it.\n\nWhen a condition occurs, MySQL does not populate all condition items\nrecognized by GET DIAGNOSTICS. For example:\n\nmysql> GET DIAGNOSTICS CONDITION 1\n         @p5 = SCHEMA_NAME, @p6 = TABLE_NAME;\nmysql> SELECT @p5, @p6;\n+------+------+\n| @p5  | @p6  |\n+------+------+\n|      |      |\n+------+------+\n\nIn standard SQL, if there are multiple conditions, the first condition\nrelates to the SQLSTATE value returned for the previous SQL statement.\nIn MySQL, this is not guaranteed. To get the main error, you cannot do\nthis:\n\nGET DIAGNOSTICS CONDITION 1 @errno = MYSQL_ERRNO;\n\nInstead, retrieve the condition count first, then use it to specify\nwhich condition number to inspect:\n\nGET DIAGNOSTICS @cno = NUMBER;\nGET DIAGNOSTICS CONDITION @cno @errno = MYSQL_ERRNO;\n\nFor information about permissible statement and condition information\nitems, and which ones are populated when a condition occurs, see\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/diagnostics-area.html#diagnosti\ncs-area-information-items.\n\nHere is an example that uses GET DIAGNOSTICS and an exception handler\nin stored procedure context to assess the outcome of an insert\noperation. If the insert was successful, the procedure uses GET\nDIAGNOSTICS to get the rows-affected count. This shows that you can use\nGET DIAGNOSTICS multiple times to retrieve information about a\nstatement as long as the current diagnostics area has not been cleared.\n\nCREATE PROCEDURE do_insert(value INT)\nBEGIN\n  -- Declare variables to hold diagnostics area information\n  DECLARE code CHAR(5) DEFAULT \'00000\';\n  DECLARE msg TEXT;\n  DECLARE nrows INT;\n  DECLARE result TEXT;\n  -- Declare exception handler for failed insert\n  DECLARE CONTINUE HANDLER FOR SQLEXCEPTION\n    BEGIN\n      GET DIAGNOSTICS CONDITION 1\n        code = RETURNED_SQLSTATE, msg = MESSAGE_TEXT;\n    END;\n\n  -- Perform the insert\n  INSERT INTO t1 (int_col) VALUES(value);\n  -- Check whether the insert was successful\n  IF code = \'00000\' THEN\n    GET DIAGNOSTICS nrows = ROW_COUNT;\n    SET result = CONCAT(\'insert succeeded, row count = \',nrows);\n  ELSE\n    SET result = CONCAT(\'insert failed, error = \',code,\', message = \',msg);\n  END IF;\n  -- Say what happened\n  SELECT result;\nEND;\n\nSuppose that t1.int_col is an integer column that is declared as NOT\nNULL.

It\nrequires the PROCESS privilege. The statement has these variants:\n\nSHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS\nSHOW ENGINE INNODB MUTEX\nSHOW ENGINE PERFORMANCE_SCHEMA STATUS\n\nSHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS displays extensive information from the\nstandard InnoDB Monitor about the state of the InnoDB storage engine.\nFor information about the standard monitor and other InnoDB Monitors\nthat provide information about InnoDB processing, see\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/innodb-monitors.html.\n\nSHOW ENGINE INNODB MUTEX displays InnoDB mutex and rw-lock statistics.\n\n*Note*:\n\nInnoDB mutexes and rwlocks can also be monitored using Performance\nSchema tables. See\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/monitor-innodb-mutex-waits-perf\normance-schema.html.\n\nSHOW ENGINE INNODB MUTEX output was removed in MySQL 5.7.2. It was\nrevised and reintroduced in MySQL 5.7.8.\n\nIn MySQL 5.7.8, mutex statistics collection is configured dynamically\nusing the following options:\n\no To enable the collection of mutex statistics, run:\n\nSET GLOBAL innodb_monitor_enable=\'latch\';\n\no To reset mutex statistics, run:\n\nSET GLOBAL innodb_monitor_reset=\'latch\';\n\no To disable the collection of mutex statistics, run:\n\nSET GLOBAL innodb_monitor_disable=\'latch\';\n\nCollection of mutex statistics for SHOW ENGINE INNODB MUTEX can also be\nenabled by setting innodb_monitor_enable=\'all\', or disabled by setting\ninnodb_monitor_disable=\'all\'.\n\nSHOW ENGINE INNODB MUTEX output has these columns:\n\no Type\n\n  Always InnoDB.\n\no Name\n\n  Prior to MySQL 5.7.8, the Name field reports the source file where\n  the mutex is implemented, and the line number in the file where the\n  mutex is created. The line number is specific to your version of\n  MySQL. As of MySQL 5.7.8, only the mutex name is reported. File name\n  and line number are still reported for rwlocks.\n\no Status\n\n  The mutex status.\n\n  Prior to MySQL 5.7.8, the Status field displays several values if\n  WITH_DEBUG was defined at MySQL compilation time. If WITH_DEBUG was\n  not defined, the statement displays only the os_waits value. In the\n  latter case (without WITH_DEBUG), the information on which the output\n  is based is insufficient to distinguish regular mutexes and mutexes\n  that protect rwlocks (which permit multiple readers or a single\n  writer). Consequently, the output may appear to contain multiple rows\n  for the same mutex. Pre-MySQL 5.7.8 Status field values include:\n\n  o count indicates how many times the mutex was requested.\n\n  o spin_waits indicates how many times the spinlock had to run.\n\n  o spin_rounds indicates the number of spinlock rounds. (spin_rounds\n    divided by spin_waits provides the average round count.)\n\n  o os_waits indicates the number of operating system waits. This\n    occurs when the spinlock did not work (the mutex was not locked\n    during the spinlock and it was necessary to yield to the operating\n    system and wait).\n\n  o os_yields indicates the number of times a thread trying to lock a\n    mutex gave up its timeslice and yielded to the operating system (on\n    the presumption that permitting other threads to run will free the\n    mutex so that it can be locked).\n\n  o os_wait_times indicates the amount of time (in ms) spent in\n    operating system waits. In MySQL 5.7 timing is disabled and this\n    value is always 0.\n\n  As of MySQL 5.7.8, the Status field reports the number of spins,\n  waits, and calls. Statistics for low-level operating system mutexes,\n  which are implemented outside of InnoDB, are not reported.\n\n  o spins indicates the number of spins.\n\n  o waits indicates the number of mutex waits.\n\n  o calls indicates how many times the mutex was requested.\n\nSHOW ENGINE INNODB MUTEX skips the mutexes and rw-locks of buffer pool\nblocks, as the amount of output can be overwhelming on systems with a\nlarge buffer pool. (There is one mutex and one rw-lock in each 16K\nbuffer pool block, and there are 65,536 blocks per gigabyte.) SHOW\nENGINE INNODB MUTEX also does not list any mutexes or rw-locks that\nhave never been waited on (os_waits=0). Thus, SHOW ENGINE INNODB MUTEX\nonly displays information about mutexes and rw-locks outside of the\nbuffer pool that have caused at least one OS-level wait.\n\nUse SHOW ENGINE PERFORMANCE_SCHEMA STATUS to inspect the internal\noperation of the Performance Schema code:\n\nmysql> SHOW ENGINE PERFORMANCE_SCHEMA STATUS\\G\n...\n*************************** 3. row ***************************\n  Type: performance_schema\n  Name: events_waits_history.size\nStatus: 76\n*************************** 4. row ***************************\n  Type: performance_schema\n  Name: events_waits_history.count\nStatus: 10000\n*************************** 5. row ***************************\n  Type: performance_schema\n  Name: events_waits_history.memory\nStatus: 760000\n...\n*************************** 57. row ***************************\n  Type: performance_schema\n  Name: performance_schema.memory\nStatus: 26459600\n...\n\nThis statement is intended to help the DBA understand the effects that\ndifferent Performance Schema options have on memory requirements.\n\nName values consist of two parts, which name an internal buffer and a\nbuffer attribute, respectively. Interpret buffer names as follows:\n\no An internal buffer that is not exposed as a table is named within\n  parentheses. Examples: (pfs_cond_class).size,\n  (pfs_mutex_class).memory.\n\no An internal buffer that is exposed as a table in the\n  performance_schema database is named after the table, without\n  parentheses. Examples: events_waits_history.size,\n  mutex_instances.count.\n\no A value that applies to the Performance Schema as a whole begins with\n  performance_schema. Example: performance_schema.memory.\n\nBuffer attributes have these meanings:\n\no size is the size of the internal record used by the implementation,\n  such as the size of a row in a table. size values cannot be changed.\n\no count is the number of internal records, such as the number of rows\n  in a table. count values can be changed using Performance Schema\n  configuration options.\n\no For a table, tbl_name.memory is the product of size and count. For\n  the Performance Schema as a whole, performance_schema.memory is the\n  sum of all the memory used (the sum of all other memory values).\n\nIn some cases, there is a direct relationship between a Performance\nSchema configuration parameter and a SHOW ENGINE value. For example,\nevents_waits_history_long.count corresponds to\nperformance_schema_events_waits_history_long_size. In other cases, the\nrelationship is more complex. For example, events_waits_history.count\ncorresponds to performance_schema_events_waits_history_size (the number\nof rows per thread) multiplied by\nperformance_schema_max_thread_instances ( the number of threads).\n\nSHOW ENGINE NDB STATUS If the server has the NDB storage engine\nenabled, SHOW ENGINE NDB STATUS displays cluster status information\nsuch as the number of connected data nodes, the cluster connectstring,\nand cluster binary log epochs, as well as counts of various Cluster API\nobjects created by the MySQL Server when connected to the cluster.\nSample output from this statement is shown here:\n\nmysql> SHOW ENGINE NDB STATUS;\n+------------+-----------------------+--------------------------------------------------+\n| Type       | Name                  | Status                                           |\n+------------+-----------------------+--------------------------------------------------+\n| ndbcluster | connection            | cluster_node_id=7,\n  connected_host=198.51.100.103, connected_port=1186, number_of_data_nodes=4,\n  number_of_ready_data_nodes=3, connect_count=0                                         |\n| ndbcluster | NdbTransaction        | created=6, free=0, sizeof=212                    |\n| ndbcluster | NdbOperation          | created=8, free=8, sizeof=660                    |\n| ndbcluster | NdbIndexScanOperation | created=1, free=1, sizeof=744                    |\n| ndbcluster | NdbIndexOperation     | created=0, free=0, sizeof=664                    |\n| ndbcluster | NdbRecAttr            | created=1285, free=1285, sizeof=60               |\n| ndbcluster | NdbApiSignal          | created=16, free=16, sizeof=136                  |\n| ndbcluster | NdbLabel              | created=0, free=0, sizeof=196                    |\n| ndbcluster | NdbBranch             | created=0, free=0, sizeof=24                     |\n| ndbcluster | NdbSubroutine         | created=0, free=0, sizeof=68                     |\n| ndbcluster | NdbCall               | created=0, free=0, sizeof=16                     |\n| ndbcluster | NdbBlob               | created=1, free=1, sizeof=264                    |\n| ndbcluster | NdbReceiver           | created=4, free=0, sizeof=68                     |\n| ndbcluster | binlog                | latest_epoch=155467, latest_trans_epoch=148126,\n  latest_received_binlog_epoch=0, latest_handled_binlog_epoch=0,\n  latest_applied_binlog_epoch=0                                                         |\n+------------+-----------------------+--------------------------------------------------+\n\nThe Status column in each of these rows provides information about the\nMySQL server\'s connection to the cluster and about the cluster binary\nlog\'s status, respectively.

A WHERE clause can be given to select rows using more\ngeneral conditions, as discussed in\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/extended-show.html.\n\nSHOW VARIABLES accepts an optional GLOBAL or SESSION variable scope\nmodifier:\n\no With a GLOBAL modifier, the statement displays global system variable\n  values. These are the values used to initialize the corresponding\n  session variables for new connections to MySQL. If a variable has no\n  global value, no value is displayed.\n\no With a SESSION modifier, the statement displays the system variable\n  values that are in effect for the current connection. If a variable\n  has no session value, the global value is displayed.

For example:\n\nSELECT @@GLOBAL.innodb_data_file_path;\n\nMost system variables can be set at server startup (read-only variables\nsuch as version_comment are exceptions). Many can be changed at runtime\nwith the SET statement. See\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/using-system-variables.html,\nand [HELP SET].\n\nWith a LIKE clause, the statement displays only rows for those\nvariables with names that match the pattern. To obtain the row for a\nspecific variable, use a LIKE clause as shown:\n\nSHOW VARIABLES LIKE \'max_join_size\';\nSHOW SESSION VARIABLES LIKE \'max_join_size\';\n\nTo get a list of variables whose name match a pattern, use the %\nwildcard character in a LIKE clause:\n\nSHOW VARIABLES LIKE \'%size%\';\nSHOW GLOBAL VARIABLES LIKE \'%size%\';\n\nWildcard characters can be used in any position within the pattern to\nbe matched.
